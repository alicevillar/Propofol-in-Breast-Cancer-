Less-immunosuppressive anesthetic techniques, such as local anesthesia with lidocaine, intravenous anesthesia (IVA) with propofol, and/or sedation with midazolam under spontaneous breathing may reduce breast cancer recurrence compared with standard general anesthesia techniques such as IVA and inhalation anesthesia with opioids under mechanical ventilation. Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze the factors involved in breast cancer recurrence in patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) under non-mechanically ventilated anesthesia. Methods: The study included 491 consecutive patients with stages 0–III breast cancer who underwent BCS/axillary lymph-node management with local anesthesia and IVA and/or sedation under non-mechanical ventilation between May 2008 and September 2021. Survival and recurrence were assessed by retrospective cohort analysis. Results: The median follow-up period was 2565 days (range, 28–4834 days). The overall and breast cancer–specific survival rates were 92.9% and 95.6%, respectively. Twenty-one deaths, of which 11 were breast cancer–related, occurred. Disease recurred in 29 (5.9%) patients, of whom 15 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and 14 patients received adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy in 12 cases). The surgical procedure performed, but not other clinicopathological factors [recurrence site, P stage, tumor subtype, and disease-free interval (DFI)], differed between the NAC and adjuvant therapy groups. The DFI tended to be shorter in the NAC group than in the adjuvant therapy group. The pathological therapeutic effect grade after NAC was 1 in 12 patients and ≥2 in 3 patients. Conclusion: More than 50% (15/29) of patients with recurrence who underwent BCS were given NAC, but most patients did not respond to it. Similarly, adjuvant chemotherapy may not have contributed to the eradication of residual tumor cells after BCS. To reduce breast cancer recurrence in patients undergoing BCS, treatment strategies, especially for patients who do not respond to NAC or adjuvant chemotherapy, need to be developed. Non-mechanical ventilation anesthesia may also affect the incidence of breast cancer recurrence. © 2022 The Authors.

No clinical study has evaluated whether anesthetic technique influences immune cell and MOR expression within human breast cancer. Methods: Excised preoperative biopsies and intraoperative breast cancer specimens from 20 patients randomly chosen from patients previously enrolled in an ongoing, prospective, randomized trial (NCT00418457) investigating the effect of anesthetic technique on long-term breast cancer outcome were immunohistochemically stained and microscopically examined by two independent investigators, masked to randomization, to quantify MOR and immune cell infiltration: CD56, CD57 (NK cells), CD4 (T helper cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells) and CD68 (macrophages). Patients had been randomized to receive either a propofol–paravertebral anesthetic with continuing analgesia (PPA, n = 10) or balanced general anesthetic with opioid analgesia (GA, n = 10). Results: There were no differences between the groups in staining intensity in preoperative biopsy specimens. Expression intensity values (median 25–75%) for MOR in intraoperative resected biopsy were higher in GA 8.5 (3–17) versus PPA 1 (0–10), p = 0.04. The numbers of MOR-positive cells were also higher in GA patients. Expression and absolute numbers of CD56, CD57, CD4 and CD68 were similar in resected tumor in both groups. Conclusion: General anesthesia with opioid analgesia increased resected tumor MOR expression compared with propofol–paravertebral anesthetic technique, but the anesthetic technique did not significantly influence the expression of immune cell markers. © 2018, The Author(s).","Anesthesia;

The thoracic pectoral nerve (PECS) block has been described as the gold standard analgesic modality for BC surgery. It has been previously reported that PECS is associated with decreased BC recurrence post-mastectomy. Although several anesthetic drugs and techniques are used in surgical oncology, their effects on the behavior of cancer cells are yet to be known and the key question of whether the anesthetic technique affects cancer outcome remains unresolved. Objectives: Since anesthetic drugs and techniques and post-operative pain may affect BC recurrence, this study aimed to determine whether the anesthetic choice and technique, PECS II block, affects in vitro apoptosis of the MDA-MB-231 BC cell line. Methods: Twenty-two female BC patients, 20 to 75-years-old, with the same pathologic grades were included in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group received propofol general anesthesia (PGA) associated with PECS and the second group received standard PGA. Blood was sampled pre and post-operation from all patients. The sera were isolated and then exposed to the MDA-MB-231 human BC cell line. The mean percentage of apoptosis indices was analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate 24 hours after treatment with patients’ sera. Results: A significant decrease was seen in the mean viability percentage of BC cell line in the PECS group, besides a significant increase in the mean percentage of necrosis and late apoptosis indices compared to the control group after exposure to sera collected from patients post-operation. Intra-group analysis of the control group showed that the exposure of the tumoral cell to post-operation sera resulted in a significant increase in the mean percentage of necrosis and late apoptosis index compared to pre-operation sera exposure. In the PECS group, the exposure of the tumoral cell to post-operation sera resulted in a significant increase in the mean percentage of cell viability and late apoptosis index compared to pre-operation sera exposure. Conclusions: In conclusion, anesthesia and BC surgery may induce apoptosis indices in the MDA-MB-231 human BC cell line. We also found that sera collected from PECS II block patients with BC could induce more apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line compared to collected sera from systemic analgesia alone after BC surgery. © 2021, Author(s).","Apoptosis;

Preoperative optimization included an octreotide infusion and anxiolysis, as well as planning a cardiostable anaesthetic that avoided any crisis stressors. Ultrasound guided thoracic (T4) ESP block using 0.2% Ropivacaine was given under propofol sedation followed by remifentanil and propofol anaesthesia. Octreotide infusion along with boluses was used to treat hypotension and bradycardia intraoperatively. The combination of perioperative octreotide administration, intraoperative remifentanil and propofol anaesthesia and ESP block provided satisfactory anaesthesia. The block was effective for 36 hours post-operatively and the patient was discharged 48 hours post admission. We suggest that a novel interfascial plane block, ESP block is a useful addition to the armamentarium of the anaesthetist in the management of a patient with carcinoid syndrome with an aim to decrease dependence on morphine and preventing conversion to chronic pain. © 2024 Author(s), Published by Innovative Publication.","Carcinoid syndrome; ESP block; Hypotension; Octreotide","","","","","","","","Vaughan DJ, Brunner MD., Anesthesia for patients with carcinoid syndrome.

Circular RNAs have drawn great attention in cancer research area and propofol is a widely applied intravenous anesthetic agent. Methods: In the current study, we explored the function of circular RNA nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (circNOLC1) in CSCs of breast cancer and the inhibitory impact of propofol on circNOLC1. Results: The expression of circNOLC1 was induced in breast cancer tissues compared with the non-tumor tissues. The silencing of circNOLC1 was able to repress the viability of breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, the numbers of colony formation were suppressed by circNOLC1 knockdown in breast cancer cells. The inhibition of circNOLC1 reduced the invasion and migration ability of breast cancer cells. The mRNA and protein levels of E-cadherin were enhanced but Vimentin levels were reduced by the silencing of circNOLC1. The repression of circNOLC1 decreased the side population (SP) ratio in breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, the sphere formation ability of breast cancer cells was attenuated by the silencing of circNOLC1. The levels of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), c-Myc, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1), and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (Sox2) were repressed by the depletion of circNOLC1 in the cells. Regarding to the mechanism, circNOLC1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for microRNA-365a-3p (miR-365a-3p) and the inhibition of miR-365a-3p rescued circNOLC1 depletion-repressed proliferation and cancer stem cell activity of breast cancer. MiR-365a-3p targeted signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in breast cancer cells and circNOLC1 enhanced STAT3 expression by sponging miR-365a-3p. The overexpression of STAT3 could reverse miR-365a-3p or circNOLC1 depletion-inhibited proliferation and cancer stem cell properties of breast cancer. Interestingly, the expression of circNOLC1 and STAT3 was repressed by the treatment of propofol. The enrichment of STAT3 on circNOLC1 promoter was inhibited by propofol. The expression of circNOLC1 was suppressed by the silencing of STAT3 in the cells. The inhibition of circNOLC1 expression by propofol was rescued under the co-treatment of STAT3 overexpression. The overexpression of circNOLC1 rescued propofol-attenuated proliferation and cancer stem cell functions in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Thus, we concluded that circNOLC1 contributes to CSCs properties and progression of breast cancer by targeting miR-365a-3p /STAT3 axis and propofol inhibited circNOLC1 by repressing STAT3 in a feedback mechanism. © 2021, The Author(s).","Breast cancer;

Apart from its anesthetic advantages, propofol has also been observed to inhibit the growth of several types of cancer cells. Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in females worldwide and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes 15-20% of all breast cancer cases. TNBC is characterized by a high recurrence rate, which is associated with its high mortality rate. The present study aimed to evaluate apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells treated with propofol. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to assess proliferation in cells treated with different concentrations of propofol. In addition, Annexin V-FITC was used to detect apoptosis. Furthermore, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was examined. The relative expression of proteins in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, such as Bak, Bax, Bcl-2, Cytochrome c, apoptotic peptidase-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), Caspase 3 and Caspase 9, were calculated relative to GAPDH with western blot analysis. A wound healing assay was performed to examine the effect of propofol on MDA-MB-468 cell migration. The present study revealed that propofol inhibited the proliferation and increased the level of ROS in MDA-MB-468 cells. The expression levels of Cytochrome c, Apaf-1, Bax, Bak and cleaved Caspase 3/9 were upregulated compared with GAPDH. The level of Bcl-2 protein was upregulated by propofol at a concentration of 5 µM and downregulated at concentrations of 10 and 20 µM. In the wound-healing assay, propofol reduced the scratch distance and area. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that propofol may induce ROS-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and promote migration in TNBC cells.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are highly immunosuppressive myeloid cells, closely linked with tumor staging, clinical therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. This study aims to investigate the effect of anesthetic technique and surgery on the expression of MDSCs and prognosis in women who received breast cancer surgery. Methods: From March 2016 to January 2017, a total of 80 patients with breast cancer were prospectively enrolled and randomized into two anesthetic groups: sevoflurane-based anesthetic group (SEV; n=38) and propofol-based total intravenous anesthetic group (TIVA; n=42). The expression of MDSCs and prognosis between different anesthetic techniques and stresses of surgical methods were compared. The primary endpoint is the postoperative expression of MDSCs and prognosis between SEV and TIVA groups. The secondary endpoint is the VAS scores at 24 hr post-operation between SEV and TIVA groups. Results: There was no significant difference in postoperative expression of MDSCs (P=0.202) and prognosis (P=0.138) between SEV and TIVA groups. Compared to breast-conserving surgery (BCS), patients who underwent breast mastectomy had significantly fewer MDSCs (P=0.040) and lower VAS score at 24 hr post-operation (P=0.044), while no significant difference in prognosis was found (P=0.953). When MDSCs were classified as subtypes of granulocytic/polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs and monocytic (Mo)-MDSCs, it showed higher ratio of Mo-MDSCs (P=0.018) or lower ratio of (PMN)-MDSCs (P=0.022) correlates to later tumor stage. Conclusion: Sevoflurane and propofol-based anesthesia do not show significant difference in MDSCs expression and prognosis after breast cancer surgery. Compared to BCS, although mastectomy with high extent of surgical stress exhibits lower levels of MDSCs, there is no significant difference in prognosis. The ratio of MDSCs subtype correlates to tumor stage. © 2019 Yan et al..","","propofol; sevoflurane; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival;

Sevoflurane may promote angiogenesis, whereas propofol can present an anti-angiogenic effect. In this study, we compared the effects of propofol/remifentanil-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and sevoflurane-based inhalational anesthesia on the release of VEGF-C and TGF-β, as well as recurrence- free survival (RFS) rates in the patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Methods: Eighty female patients undergoing breast cancer resection were enrolled and randomized to receive either sevoflurane-based inhalational anesthesia (SEV group) or propofol/remifentanil-based TIVA (TIVA group). The serum concentrations of VEGF-C and TGF-β before and 24 h after surgery were measured and RFS rates over a two-year follow-up were analyzed in both groups. The postoperative pain scores assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the use of perioperative opioids were also evaluated. Results: Although VAS scores at 2 h and 24 h after surgery were comparable between the two groups, there were more patients receiving postoperative fentanyl in the TIVA group (16[40%]) compared with the SEV group (6[15%], p = 0.023). VEGF-C serum concentrations increased after surgery from 105 (87-193) pg/ml to174 (111-281) pg/ml in the SEV group (P = 0.009), but remained almost unchanged in the TIVA group with 134 (80-205) pg/ml vs.140(92-250) pg/ml(P = 0.402). The preoperative to postoperative change for VEGF-C of the SEV group (50 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that of the TIVA group (12 pg/ml) with a difference of 46 (- 11-113) pg/ml (P = 0.008). There were also no significant differences in the preoperative and postoperative TGF-β concentrations between the two groups. The two-year RFS rates were 78% and 95% in the SEV and TIVA groups (P = 0.221), respectively. Conclusion: In comparison with sevoflurane-based inhalational anesthesia, propofol/remifentanil -based total intravenous anesthesia can effectively inhibit the release of VEGF-C induced by breast surgery, but didn't seem to be beneficial in the short-term recurrence rate of breast cancer.

Methods: A total of 115 patients who underwent radical mastectomy for breast cancer at our hospital from January 2019 to January 2021 were selected as the study subjects. The patients were allocated to the control group (n=57) or observation group (n=58) using a random number method. The control group was given simple general anesthesia, and the observation group was given TTP-PECS block combined with propofol anesthesia. The recovery time, pain [visual analogue scoring (VAS)] scores, and incidences of adverse reactions were compared between the 2 groups. Hemodynamic indicators [i.e., heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP)], stress indicators [i.e., blood glucose (GLU), epinephrine (E), cortisol (Cor)], and the cellular immune function ofthe2 groups before anesthesia (T0), at the end of operation (T1), 1day after operation (T2) and 3days after operation (T3) were recorded. Results: The spontaneous respiration recovery time, time to full wakefulness and the extubation time of the observation group were shorter than those of the control group (P<0.05). The observation group had lower VAS scores than the control group at 2, 8, 12, and 24 h after operation (P<0.05). The levels of MAP, HR, GLU, E and Cor in the observation group at T1, T2, and T3 were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). Compared to the control group, the observation group had increased cluster of differentiation (CD)3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+ cells (P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in CD8+ and natural killer (NK) cells between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (8.62% vs. 24.56%) (P<0.05).

Surgical resection of the primary tumour is indicated in 70% of cases. The perioperative stress response, tissue hypoxia at the site of surgery, and acute pain contribute to immunosuppression and neo-angiogenesis, potentially promoting tumour survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Poorly controlled acute postoperative pain decreases Natural Killer (NK) immune cell activity, which could potentially facilitate circulating tumour cells from evading immune detection. This consequently promotes tumour growth and distal metastasis. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for links between acute pain and cancer outcomes using multiple online databases. Relevant articles from January 1st, 2010 to September 1st, 2021 were analysed and appraised on whether postoperative pain control can modulate the risk of recurrence, metastasis, and overall cancer survival. Results: Although experimental and retrospective clinical data suggest a plausible role for regional anaesthesia in cancer outcome modulation, this has not been supported by the single, largest prospective trial to date concerning breast cancer. While there are mixed results on anaesthesiology drug-related interventions, the most plausible data relates to total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol, and to systemic administration of lidocaine. Conclusion: The hypothesis that anaesthetic and analgesic technique during cancer surgery could influence risk of subsequent recurrence or metastasis has been prevalent for >15 years. The first, large-scale definitive trial among women with breast cancer found robust equivalent findings between volatile anaesthesia with opioid analgesia and regional anaesthesia. Therefore, while regional anaesthesia during tumour resection does not seem to have any effect on cancer outcomes, it remains plausible that other anaesthetic techniques (e.g. total intravenous anaesthesia and systemic lidocaine infusion) might influence oncologic outcome in other major tumour resection surgery (e.g. colorectal and lung). Therefore, another large trial is needed to definitively answer these specific research questions. Until such evidence is available, perioperative analgesia for cancer surgery of curative intent should be based on patient co-morbidity and non-cancer endpoints, such as optimising analgesia and minimising postoperative complications.

It has the worst prognosis and no targeted treatments. Here, we show that propofol, a drug commonly used during breast cancer resection surgery, may inhibit the progression of TNBC. MDA-MB-231 cells were used as an in vitro model of TNBC. We found that propofol decreased invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. Furthermore, treatment with propofol correlated with decreased expression of prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 (PMEPA1), a gene highly enriched in several type cancer cells that promotes metastasis and is associated with low patient survival in TNBC patients. Cumulatively, propofol warrants additional investigation as a possible therapeutic treatment and anesthesia choice for TNBC patients. © 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

We tested the hypothesis that a propofol-paravertebral anesthetic (PPA) technique would attenuate postoperative changes in these angiogenic factors to a greater extent than balanced general anesthesia (GA) and morphine analgesia in women undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer. METHOD:: Forty women with primary breast cancer undergoing surgical excision were randomized to receive either standard GA or PPA technique. Venous blood was sampled before and at 24 h after surgery and serum analyzed. The primary endpoint was a preoperative versus postoperative change in vascular endothelial growth factor C and transforming growth factor β concentrations. Results: Using a visual analog scale (median [25-75% interquartile range]), PPA patients (1 [0-2]) had less pain at 2 h (P = 0.02) than did GA patients (3 [2-5]). The mean postoperative change in vascular endothelial growth factor C concentrations among GA patients was 733 versus 27 pg/ml for PPA patients (difference, 706 [97.5% CI, 280-1,130] pg/ml, P = 0.001). In contrast, the mean postoperative change in transforming growth factor β concentration among GA patients was -163 versus 146 pg/ml for PPA patients (difference, 309 [97.5% CI, -474 to -143] pg/ml, P = 0.005). Concentrations of placental growth factor and fibroblast growth factor, both acidic and basic, were undetectable in serum. Conclusion: Anesthetic technique influences serum concentrations of factors associated with angiogenesis in primary breast cancer surgery. © 2010, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Madrid, Spain","Introduction: The main reason for high mortality in breast cancer is local recurrence and metastasis, despite surgery as the first therapeutic option. The anesthesia used in the operation room can determine the immune response. Methods: A prospective, comparative and non-randomized study in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery was conducted in our hospital after obtaining approval from the Hospital's Institutional Review Board. Patients were divided in two groups: Group A received general anesthesia with propofol and opioids. Group B, in addition to general anesthesia, three interfascial blocks (Pec I, Pec II and BRILMA) were performed in all patients. Three blood samples were taken 1) previous anesthetic induction; 2) two hours after the end of the surgery and 3) 24-48 hours after surgery. Leukocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8 and Natural Killer cells were determined at each time. Results: 103 patients were included. 59 (group A) received general anesthesia and 54 (group B) general anesthesia and interfascial blocks. Regarding baseline characteristics, age was significantly higher in the group that received general anesthesia and mastectomy was more frequent in the group that received interfascial blocks. We observed after surgery an increase in leukocytes level that returns close to baseline levels. On the other hand, a reduction in the immune response was observed that also returns to the previous level 48 hours after surgery. Group A and B get similar results and also subgroups of hormonal receptors (HER+, PR and/or ER+). Conclusions: Interfascial blocks in chest wall added to general anesthesia in breast cancer surgery has not shown a significant difference in the inflammatory response or immunological depression compared to general anesthesia as the only anesthetic technique. It seems to trend less immunological depression in the interfascial block group. © 2021 Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor","Anaesthesia and analgesia; Breast cancer surgery; Inmunossupresion; Nerve block; Regional anesthesia","Anesthetics; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Immunity; Mastectomy; Nerve Block; Pain, Postoperative; Prospective Studies; anesthetic agent; breast tumor; controlled study; female; human; immunity; mastectomy; nerve block; pathology; postoperative pain; procedures; prospective study; randomized controlled trial","","Anesthetics, ","","","","","Dai X., Li T., Bai Z., Yang Y., Liu X., Zhan J., Et al., Breast cancer intrinsic subtype classification, clinical use and future trends, Am J Cancer Res., 5, pp. 2929-2943, (2015); Ni Eochagain A., Burns D., Riedel B., Sessler D.I., Buggy D.J., The effect of anaesthetic technique during primary breast cancer surgery on neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, platelet–lymphocyte ratio and return to intended oncological therapy, Anaesthesia., 73, pp. 603-611, (2018); Sessler D.I., Pei L., Huang Y., Fleischmann E., Marhofer P., Kurz A., Et al., Recurrence of breast cancer after regional or general anaesthesia: a randomised controlled trial, Lancet., 394, pp. 1807-1815, (2019); Deegan C.A., Murray D., Doran P., Moriarty D.C., Sessler D.I., Mascha E., Et al., Anesthetic technique and the cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase response to primary breast cancer surgery, Reg Anesth Pain Med., 35, (2010); Hiller J.G., Perry N.J., Poulogiannis G., Riedel B., Sloan E.K., Perioperative events influence cancer recurrence risk after surgery, Nat Rev Clin Oncol., 15, pp. 205-218, (2018); Ryungsa K., Effects of surgery and anesthetic choice on immunosuppression and cancer recurrence, Transl Med., 16, (2018); Li R., Liu H., Dilger J., Lin J., Effect of Propofol on breast Cancer cell, the immune system, and patient outcome, BMC Anesthesiol., 18, (2018); Perez-Gonzalez O., Cuellar-Guzman L.F., Soliz J., Cata J.P., Impact of regional anesthesia on recurrence metastasis and immune response in breast cancer surgery: A systematic review of literature, Reg Anesth Pain Med., 42, pp. 751-756, (2017); Jaura A.I., Flood G., Gallagher H.C., Buggy D.J., Differential effects of serum from patients administered distinct anaesthetic techniques on apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro: a pilot study, Br J Anaesth., 113, pp. i63-i67, (2014); Buckley A., McQuaid S., Johnson P., Buggy D.J., Effect of anaesthetic technique on the natural killer cell anti-tumour activity of serum from women undergoing breast cancer surgery: a pilot study, Br J Anaesth., 113, pp. i56-i62, (2014); Blanco R., The'pecs block’: a novel technique for providing analgesia after breast surgery, Anaesthesia., 66, pp. 847-848, (2011); Perez M.F., Miguel J.G., de la Torre P.A., A new approach to pectoralis block, Anaesthesia., 68, (2013); Blanco R., Fajardo M., Parras Maldonado T., Ultra-sound description of the Pecs II (modified Pecs I): A novel approach into breast surgery, Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim., 59, pp. 470-475, (2012); Fajardo M., Dieguez P., Lopez S., Alfaro P., Garcia F.J., Abordaje ecoguiado de las ramas cutáneas de los nervios intercostales (BRILMA) a nivel de la línea media axilar para cirugía no reconstructiva de mama, Cir May Amb., 18, pp. 4-7, (2013); Ben-Eliyahu S., Page G.G., Yirmiya R., Shakhar G., Evidence that stress and surgical interventions promote tumor development by suppressing natural killer cell activity, Int J Cancer., 80, pp. 880-888, (1999); Connally C., Buggy D.J., Opioids and tumour metastasis: does the choice of the anesthetic-analgesic technique influence outcome after cancer surgery?, Curr Opin Anaesthesiol., 29, pp. 458-474, (2016); Iwasaki M., Zhao H., Jaffer T., Unwith S., Benzonana L., Lian Q., Et al., Volatile anesthetics enhance the metastasis related cellular signaling including CXCR2 of ovarian cells, Oncotarget., 7, pp. 26042-26046, (2016); Onuma A.E., Zhang H., Gil L., Huang H., Tsung A., Surgical stress promotes tumor progression: a focus on the impact of the immune response, J Clin Med., 9, (2020); Orozco H.D., Garutti I., Moraga F.J.G., Sanchez-Pedrosa G., Diseminación tumoral perioperatoria. 1.

The changes of tumor microenvironment caused by anesthetic drugs received increasing attention. Till now, it’s still unclear whether or not anesthetic drugs may exert positive or negative impact on cancer outcomes after surgery. Breast cancer is the most common tumor and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Propofol and sevoflurane are respectively the most commonly used intravenous and inhaled anesthetics. Debates regarding which of the two most commonly used anesthetics may relatively contribute to the recurrence and metastasis vulnerability of breast cancer postoperatively remain. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive view about the effect of propofol versus sevoflurane on the prognosis of breast cancer obtained from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies. Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that sevoflurane may enhance the recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer, while propofol is more likely to reduce the activity of breast cancer cells by attenuating the suppression of the immune system, promoting tumor cells apoptosis, and through other direct anti-tumor effects. However, retrospective clinical studies have shown contradictory results about the effects of propofol and sevoflurane on long-term survival in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, recent prospective studies did not identify significant differences between propofol and sevoflurane in breast cancer metastasis and recurrence. Therefore, more preclinical studies and randomized controlled studies are needed to guide the choice of anesthetics for breast cancer patients.

For more than three decades, the potential for general anesthesia to affect cancer outcomes has been a subject of concern with considerable research interest. Here, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effect of inhalational anesthesia (IHNA) vs. propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) on metastasis and recurrence after cancer surgery from clinical and pre-clinical studies. The relative risk for metastasis/recurrence in TIVA is 0.61 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.46 to 0.82, p = 0.0009) compared to IHNA. Inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in cancer metastasis following cancer surgery, thus we analyzed inflammatory cytokines levels after surgery under IHNA or TIVA. Based on pooled analysis, a lower IL-6 level was noticed in TIVA in comparison to IHNA (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.097 to 1.44, I2 = 92%, p = 0.02) but not TNF-α or IL-10. Preclinical animal model studies show that inhalational anesthetics increase the risk of breast cancer metastasis compared to propofol. In conclusion, the current evidence suggests intravenous anesthetic propofol is associated with less metastasis/recurrence and lower postoperative IL-6 level over inhaled anesthetics in the oncological surgery. We urge more well-designed clinical and preclinical studies in this field. © 2023 by the authors.","cancer surgery; desflurane; IL-10; IL-6; inhalational anesthesia; isoflurane; metastasis; propofol; recurrence; sevoflurane; TNF-α; total intravenous anesthesia","anesthetic agent; cytokine; desflurane; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; isoflurane; propofol; sevoflurane; tumor necrosis factor; anesthesia; breast cancer; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer surgery; clinical study; confidence interval; data extraction; general anesthesia; human; inhalational anesthesia; intravenous anesthesia; metastasis; nonhuman; postoperative period; preclinical study; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; standardization; statistical analysis; systematic review","","desflurane, 57041-67-5; isoflurane, 26675-46-7; propofol, 2078-54-8; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6","","","","","Horowitz M., Neeman E., Sharon E., Ben-Eliyahu S., Exploiting the critical perioperative period to improve long-term cancer outcomes, Nat.

This study compared the changes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress of cancer cells and lymphocytes after propofol-and sevoflurane-based anesthesia during breast cancer surgery. Methods: We randomized 53 patients undergoing breast cancer surgery to propofol (n = 28) and sevoflurane (n = 25) anesthesia groups. Blood samples were obtained immediately before inducing anesthesia, and 1 and 24 h postoperatively. Human breast cancer cell lines were cultured and treated with patient plasma, and the frequency of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) on the cancer cell lines and lymphocytes was measured. The neutro-phil-to-lymphocyte ratio in plasma was evaluated in both groups. Results: The CHOP expression on breast cancer cell lines did not differ between the groups (P = 0.108), although it decreased significantly over time (P = 0.027). The CHOP expression on lymphocytes was comparable between the groups (P = 0.485), and was the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.501). Conclusions: Propofol-based anesthesia did not induce greater ER stress than sevoflu-rane-based anesthesia during breast cancer surgery. The ER stress of cancer cells did not differ according to the type of anesthesia during breast cancer surgery. © The Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2022.","Anesthesia; Apoptosis; Breast neoplasms; Endoplasmic reticulum; Propofol; Sevoflurane","Breast Neoplasms; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Female; Humans; Mastectomy; Propofol; Sevoflurane; ephedrine; fentanyl; glycopyrronium; ketorolac; neostigmine; phenylephrine; propofol; ramosetron; remifentanil; rocuronium; sevoflurane; thiopental; sevoflurane; adult; anesthesia; apoptosis; Article; bispectral index; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; breast tumor; cancer surgery; controlled study; drug withdrawal; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; endotracheal intubation; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; human; human cell; leukocyte count; lymphocyte; major clinical study; male; MCF-7 cell line; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; protein expression; randomized controlled trial; visual analog scale; breast tumor; endoplasmic reticulum stress; mastectomy","","ephedrine, 299-42-3, 50-98-6, 17140-28-2; fentanyl, 437-38-7, 1443-54-5; glycopyrronium, 596-51-0, 1624259-25-1, 740028-90-4, 13283-82-4, 51186-83-5, 873295-46-6; ketorolac, 74103-06-3; neostigmine, 114-80-7, 588-17-0, 59-99-4, 8048-84-8; phenylephrine, 532-38-7, 59-42-7, 61-76-7; propofol, 2078-54-8; ramosetron, 132036-88-5, 132907-72-3; remifentanil, 132539-07-2, 132875-61-7; rocuronium, 119302-91-9, 143558-00-3; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; thiopental, 71-73-8, 76-75-5; Propofol, ; Sevoflurane, ","","","Ministry of Science, Information & Communication Technology, (2021R1A2C1003360); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, Information & Communication Technology (Grant no: 2021R1A2C1003360).","Biwer LA, Isakson BE., Endoplasmic reticulum-mediated signal-ling in cellular microdomains, Acta Physiol (Oxf), 219, pp. 162-175, (2017); Iurlaro R, Munoz-Pinedo C., Cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, FEBS J, 283, pp. 2640-2652, (2016); Oakes SA, Papa FR., The role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in human pathology, Annu Rev Pathol, 10, pp. 173-194, (2015); Kim H, Bhattacharya A, Qi L., Endoplasmic reticulum quality control in cancer: friend or foe, Semin Cancer Biol, 33, pp. 25-33, (2015); Cakmakkaya OS, Kolodzie K, Apfel CC, Pace NL., Anaesthetic techniques for risk of malignant tumour recurrence, Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 11, (2014); Wigmore TJ, Mohammed K, Jhanji S., Long-term survival for patients undergoing volatile versus iv anesthesia for cancer sur-gery: a retrospective analysis, Anesthesiology, 124, pp. 69-79, (2016); Cruz FF, Rocco PR, Pelosi P., Anti-inflammatory properties of anesthetic agents, Crit Care, 21, (2017); Alam A, Rampes S, Patel S, Hana Z, Ma D., Anesthetics or anesthetic techniques and cancer surgical outcomes: a possible link, Korean J Anesthesiol, 74, pp. 191-203, (2021); Wang L, Tang W, Jiang T, Lu P, Li Y, Sun A, Et al., Endoplasmic reticulum stress is involved in the neuroprotective effect of propofol, Neurochem Res, 39, pp. 1741-1752, (2014); Wang H, Dong Y, Zhang J, Xu Z, Wang G, Swain CA, Et al., Iso-flurane induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and caspase acti-vation through ryanodine receptors, Br J Anaesth, 113, pp. 695-707, (2014); Minto CF, Schnider TW, Egan TD, Youngs E, Lemmens HJ, Gambus PL, Et al., Influence of age and gender on the pharmaco-kinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil.

Currently, the mechanism underlying the relationship between propofol and breast cancer is controversial and limited to cell apoptosis. Moreover, there are only a few studies on the effect of propofol on the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of TNBC cells. Therefore, this study explored whether propofol and its commonly used clinical formulations affect the proliferation and chemotherapeutic effects on TNBC cells by regulating cell ferroptosis. Methods: We selected MDA-MB-231 cells, and the effects of propofol, propofol injectable emulsion (PIE), or fospropofol disodium, alone or combined with doxorubicin or paclitaxel on cell viability, apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, ferroptosis-related morphological changes, intracellular Fe2+ levels, and the expression and localization of ferroptosis-related proteins were investigated. Results: We found that propofol significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, and all three propofol formulations augmented the anti-tumor effects of doxorubicin and paclitaxel. The results from the ROS assay, transmission electron microscopy, intracellular Fe2+ assay, western blotting, and multiplex immunohistochemistry revealed that propofol not only induced apoptosis but also triggered ferroptosis-related changes, including morphological changes of mitochondria, increased intracellular ROS levels, and intracellular iron accumulation in MDA-MB-231 cells. The ferroptosis-related p53-SLC7A11-GPX4 pathway was also altered under different treatment propofol, doxorubicin, or paclitaxel regimens. Conclusion: Propofol showed anti-proliferation effects on TNBC cells and could be a potential adjuvant to enhance the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of TNBC cells partly by promoting cell ferroptosis.

An increased neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio reflects these processes and is associated with adverse cancer outcomes. Whether anaesthetic technique for breast cancer surgery influences these factors, and potentially cancer recurrence, remains unknown. We conducted a secondary analysis in patients enrolled in an ongoing trial of anaesthetic technique on breast cancer recurrence. The primary hypothesis was that postoperative neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio is lower in patients allocated to receive propofol-paravertebral rather than inhalational agent-opioid anaesthesia for primary breast cancer surgery. Among 397 patients, 116 had differential white cell counts performed pre-operatively and postoperatively. Pre-operative neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio was similar in the propofol-paravertebral 2.3 (95%CI 1.8–2.8) and inhalational agent-opioid anaesthesia 2.2 (1.9–3.2) groups, p = 0.72. Postoperative neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio was lower (3.0 (2.4–4.2) vs. 4.0 (2.9–5.4), p = 0.001) in the propofol-paravertebral group. Propofol-paravertebral anaesthesia attenuated the postoperative increase in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland","anaesthesia: general; anaesthesia: propofol; anaesthesia: regional; breast cancer; white blood cells: lymphocytes; white blood cells: neutrophils","Anesthesia; Anesthesia, Inhalation; Anesthesia, Intravenous; Anesthesia, Spinal; Breast Neoplasms; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Lymphocyte Count; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neutrophils; Platelet Count; Postoperative Period; Propofol; Treatment Outcome; anesthetic agent; morphine; propofol; sevoflurane; propofol; adult; anesthesia; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cancer therapy; clinical trial; comparative study; delirium; drug effect; female; human; length of stay; leukocyte count; leukocyte differential count; lower respiratory tract infection; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; middle aged; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; platelet count; platelet lymphocyte ratio; postoperative period; preoperative period; primary tumor; secondary analysis; university hospital; visual analog scale; breast tumor; controlled study; inhalation anesthesia; intravenous anesthesia; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; mastectomy; multimodality cancer therapy; neutrophil; platelet count; randomized controlled trial; spinal anesthesia; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence","","morphine, 52-26-6, 57-27-2; propofol, 2078-54-8; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; Propofol, ","","","British Journal of Anaesthesia international","This work was funded in part by the College of Anaesthesiologists of Ireland, Eccles Unit Breast Cancer Research Fund and a British Journal of Anaesthesia international grant 2017.

Metastatic recurrence is the main cause of breast cancer-related deaths. Tumour cell proliferation and migration are crucial steps in the metastatic process. Several perioperative factors, including general anaesthesia and opioid analgesia, adversely affect immune function, potentially increasing metastatic recurrence. Regional anaesthesia-analgesia has been consistently shown to attenuate the stress response to surgery, and also reduce opioid and general anaesthesia requirements, thereby attenuating this perioperative immunosuppression. We investigated the effect of serum from breast cancer surgery patients who received different anaesthetic techniques on breast cancer cell function in vitro. Methods. Patients were randomized to receive propofol/paravertebral anaesthesia-analgesia (propofol/paravertebral, n=11) or sevoflurane general anaesthesia with opioid analgesia (sevoflurane/opioid, n=11). The ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line was treated with patient serum from both groups. The effects on proliferation and migration were measured. Results. Treatment groups were well balanced for age, weight, surgical procedure, and cancer pathology. Pain scores were lower at 1 and 2 h in the propofol/paravertebral analgesia group. Compared with preoperative values, proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with postoperative patient serum at 10% concentration from the propofol/paravertebral group was significantly reduced compared with the sevoflurane/opioid group (-24% vs 73%, P=0.01). There was no significant change in MDA-MB-231 cell migration after treatment with patient serum between the two groups. Conclusions. Serum from patients receiving propofol/paravertebral anaesthesia for breast cancer surgery inhibited proliferation, but not migration, of ER-MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro, to a greater extent than that from patients receiving sevoflurane/opioid anaesthesia- analgesia. This implies that anaesthetic technique alters the serum molecular milieu in ways that may affect breast cancer cell function, possibly by altering anaesthetic and opioid drug administration and resultant pain scores.","Anaesthesia, general;

The authors hypothesized that propofol is less immunosuppressive than volatile anesthetics. The objective of this randomized trial was to compare the changes in cluster of differentiation 39 and 73 expression on regulatory T cells between propofol- and sevoflurane-based anesthesia during breast cancer surgery. Methods: A total of 201 patients having breast cancer surgery were randomly assigned and analyzed (n = 99 for propofol, n = 102 for sevoflurane). Blood samples were obtained immediately before anesthesia induction and 1 and 24 h postoperatively. The frequency of cluster of differentiation 39 and 73 expression on circulating regulatory T cells (primary outcome) and the frequency of circulating type 1 and type 17 helper T cells, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T cells were investigated. Serum cytokines and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were also evaluated. Results: Changes in cluster of differentiation 39 and 73 expression on regulatory T cells over time did not differ with propofol and sevoflurane groups (difference [95% confidence interval]: 0.01 [-2.04 to 2.06], P = 0.995 for cluster of differentiation 39; -0.93 [-3.12 to 1.26], P = 0.403 for cluster of differentiation 73). There were no intergroup differences in type 1, type 17 helper T cells, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, cytokines, or the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Conclusions: Changes in immune cells were similar with propofol and sevoflurane during breast cancer surgery. The effect of anesthetics on the perioperative immune activity may be minimal during cancer surgery. © 2018, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

Effects of anaesthetic drugs on breast cancer cell function are unclear. The Neuroepithelial Cell Transforming Gene 1 (NET1) gene is associated with promoting migration in adenocarcinoma in vitro. Therefore, we investigated the role of NET1 in the effect of anaesthetic drugs propofol and bupivacaine on breast cancer cell function in vitro. Materials and Methods: Estrogen receptor-negative (ERnegative) MDA-MB-231 and ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells were incubated with propofol (1-10 μg/ml) and bupivacaine (0.5-100 μg/ml) or control medium. Cell functions were determined with the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Chemotaxis 96-well Cell Migration and Invasion Assay. NET1 gene expression was determined by real-time PCR with gene silencing using siRNA and stimulation by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Results: Propofol did not reduce breast cancer cell proliferation of MCF7 or MDA-MB- 231 cells. However, it did reduce migration of both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells which was reversed by silencing NET1. Propofol reduced invasion of MCF7 but not of MDA-MB-231 cells, which was unaffected by siRNA. Propofol reduced expression of NET1 by 42-88% in MCF7 and by 49-79% in MDA-MB-231 cells. Bupivacaine had no significant effect on breast cancer cell function or NET1 expression. Conclusion: Propofol reduced NET1 expression and cell migration in both ER-positive and -negative cells, which was reversed by silencing NET1, implying a role for NET1 in mediating the effect of propofol on breast cancer cell function in vitro.","Breast cancer cells;

In our study, we found another effect of propofol in the therapy of chronic cancer patients. We used the breast cancer cell lines to detect the effects and molecular mechanisms of clinically relevant concentrations of propofol, finding that propofol reduced the level of MMP breast cancer by inhibition of NF-κB pathways, which restrained migration and invasion of breast cancer cells significantly. Our finding provides a new sight into propofol in cancer treatment and, suggesting that propofol not only can be an anesthesia agent which reduces pain but plays a important role of inhibiting the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in the therapy of chronic breast cancer patients. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Breast cancer; Invasion; MMP; NF-κB; Propofol","Anesthetics, Intravenous; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Neoplasm Invasiveness; NF-kappa B; Propofol; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; propofol; article; breast cancer; cancer cell culture; cancer invasion; cancer patient; cell migration; controlled study; drug mechanism; human; human cell; MDAMB 231 cell; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction","","gelatinase A, 146480-35-5; gelatinase B, 146480-36-6; propofol, 2078-54-8; Anesthetics, Intravenous, ; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2, 3.4.24.24; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9, 3.4.24.35; NF-kappa B, ; Propofol, 2078-54-8","","","","","Adams J.M., Cory S., The Bcl-2 protein family: arbiters of cell survival, Science, 28, 281, pp. 1322-1326, (1998); Stetler-Stevenson W.G., The role of matrix metalloproteinases in tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, Surg Oncol Clin N Am, 10, pp. 383-392, (2001); Mammoto T., Mukai M., Mammoto A., Et al., Intravenous anaesthetic, propofol inhibits invasion of cancer cells, Cancer Lett, 184, pp. 165-170, (2002); Kushida A., Inada T., Shingu K., Enhancement of antitumor immunity after propofol treatment in mice, Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol, 29, pp. 477-486, (2007); Yufeng M., Youwei Z., Haijun W., Longbang C., Fangyu W., GABA-receptor agonist, propofol inhibits invasion of colon carcinoma cells, Biomed Pharmacother, 64, pp. 583-588, (2010); Bali M., Akabas M.H., Defi{ligature}ning the propofol-binding site location on the GABAA receptor, Mol Pharmacol, 65, pp. 68-76, (2004); Garib V., Lang K., Niggemann B., Zanker K.S., Brandt L., Dittmar T., Propofol-induced calcium signalling and actin reorganization within breast carcinoma cells, Eur J Anaesthesiol, 22, pp. 609-615, (2005); Lee K.J., Kim Y.M., Kim D.Y., Et al., Release of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and the effects of extracellular Hsp70 on matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in human monocytic U937 cells, Exp Mol Med, 38, pp. 364-374, (2006); Iimuro Y., Nishiura T., Hellerbrand C., Et al., NF-κB prevents apoptosis and liver dysfunction during liver regeneration, J Clin Invest, 101, pp. 802-811, (1998); Gu Z., Qiu W., He R., Zhang Z., Zhou X., Selection of quantitative criteria for evaluating metastases of a highly metastatic salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cell line to the lungs of nude mice, Chin J Dent Res, 2, pp. 16-20, (1999); Himelstein B.P., Lee E.J., Sato H., Seiki M., Muschel R.J., Tumor cell contact mediated transcriptional activation of the fi{ligature}broblast matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene: involvement of multiple transcription factors including Ets and an alternating purine-pyrimidine repeat, Clin Exp Metastasis, 16, pp. 169-177, (1998); Hu Y., Ivashkiv L.B., Costimulation of chemokine receptor signaling by matrix metalloproteinase-9 mediates enhanced migration of IFN-alpha dendritic cells, J Immunol, 176, pp. 6022-6033, (2006); Beppu M., Ikebe T., Shirasuna K., The inhibitory effects of immuno-suppressive factors, dexamethasone and interleukin4, on NF-kappaB-mediated protease production by oral cancer, Biochim Biophys Acta, 1586, pp. 11-22, (2002); Pahl H.L., Activators and target genes of Rel/NF-κB transcription factors, Oncogene, 18, pp. 6853-6866, (1999); Yeh C.C., Wu L.T., Lin S.Y., Li T.M., Chung J.G., The inhibition of N-acetyltransferase activity and gene expression in human bladder cancer cells (T24) by shikonin, In Vivo, 18, pp. 21-31, (2004); Zhang J., Peng B., In vitro angiogenesis and expression of nuclear factor kappa B and VEGF in high and low metastasis cell lines of salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma, BMC Cancer, 1, (2007); Karin M., Nuclear factor-kappaB in cancer development and progression, Nature, 441, pp. 431-436, (2006); Mikawa K., Akamatsu H., Nishina K., Shiga M., Maekawa N., Obara H., Et al., Propofol inhibits human neutrophil functions, Anesth Analg, 87, pp. 695-700, (1998); Vicente J.C., Lequerica-Fernandez P., Lopez-Arranz J.S., Esteban I., Fresno M.F., Astudillo A., Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in high-grade salivary gland carcinomas is associated with their metastatic potential, Laryngoscope, 118, (2008); Pikarsky E., Stein I., Et al., NF-κB functions as a tumour promoter in inflammation-associated cancer, Nature, 431, pp. 461-466, (2004)","Q.

We compared the effects of general anesthetics sevoflurane versus propofol on breast cancer cell survival, proliferation and invasion in vitro. The investigation focused on effects in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis as a mechanism for general anesthetic-mediated effects on breast cancer cell survival and metastasis. Methods: Estrogen receptor-positive (MCF7) and estrogen receptor-negative (MDA-MB-436) human breast cancer cell lines along with normal breast tissue (MCF10A) were used. Cells were exposed to sevoflurane or propofol at clinically relevant and extreme doses and durations for dose- A nd time-dependence studies. Cell survival, proliferation and migration following anesthetic exposure were assessed. Intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ concentrations were modulated using Ca2+ chelation and a TRPV1 Ca2+ channel antagonist to examine the role of Ca2+ in mediating anesthetic effects. Results: Sevoflurane affected breast cancer cell survival in dose-, time- A nd cell type-dependent manners. Sevoflurane, but not propofol, at equipotent and clinically relevant doses (2% vs. 2 μM) for 6 h significantly promoted breast cell survival in all three types of cells. Paradoxically, extreme exposure to sevoflurane (4%, 24 h) decreased survival in all three cell lines. Chelation of cytosolic Ca2+ dramatically decreased cell survival in both breast cancer lines but not control cells. Inhibition of TRPV1 receptors significantly reduced cell survival in all cell types, an effect that was partially reversed by equipotent sevoflurane but not propofol. Six-hour exposure to sevoflurane or propofol did not affect cell proliferation, metastasis or TRPV1 protein expression in any type of cell. Conclusion: Sevoflurane, but not propofol, at clinically relevant concentrations and durations, increased survival of breast cancer cells in vitro but had no effect on cell proliferation, migration or TRPV1 expression. Breast cancer cells require higher cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels for survival than normal breast tissue. Sevoflurane affects breast cancer cell survival via modulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Anesthetics; Breast; Ca<sup>2 +</sup>; Cancer; Metastasis; Survival; TRP Channel","Anesthetics, Inhalation;

However, evidence from prospective studies focusing on breast cancer is currently limited. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effect of anesthesia-related interventions on oncological outcomes following breast cancer surgery in prospective studies. Methods Literature searches were performed from inception to June. 2023 in the Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials databases. The main inclusion criteria comprised a minimum of one-year follow-up duration, with oncological outcomes as endpoints. Anesthesia-related interventions encompassed, but were not limited to, type of anesthesia, anesthetics, and analgesics. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Results A total of 9 studies were included. Anesthesia-related interventions included paravertebral nerve block (3), pectoral nerve block (1), sevoflurane (2), ketorolac (2), and infiltration of lidocaine (1). Cancer recurrence, metastasis, disease-free survival, or (and) overall survival were assessed. Among all included studies, only infiltration of lidocaine was found to prolong disease-free survival and overall survival. Conclusion Regional anesthesia and propofol did not improve oncological outcomes following breast cancer surgery. The anti-tumorigenic effect of ketorolac warrants future studies with larger sample sizes. Perioperative infiltration of lidocaine around the tumor may be a promising anti-tumorigenic intervention that can prolong overall survival in patients with early breast cancer. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

This trial aimed to assess postoperative circulating tumor cell counts - an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer - to determine how anesthesia may indirectly affect prognosis. It was hypothesized that patients receiving sevoflurane would have higher postoperative tumor cell counts. Methods: The parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted in two centers in Switzerland. Patients aged 18 to 85 yr without metastases and scheduled for primary breast cancer surgery were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to either sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. The patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was circulating tumor cell counts over time, assessed at three time points postoperatively (0, 48, and 72 h) by the CellSearch assay. Secondary outcomes included maximal circulating tumor cells value, positivity (cutoff: at least 1 and at least 5 tumor cells/7.5 ml blood), and the association between natural killer cell activity and tumor cell counts. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02005770). Results: Between March 2014 and April 2018, 210 participants were enrolled, assigned to sevoflurane (n = 107) or propofol (n = 103) anesthesia, and eventually included in the analysis. Anesthesia type did not affect circulating tumor cell counts over time (median circulating tumor cell count [interquartile range]; for propofol: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 1 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 0 [0 to 1] at 72 h; and for sevoflurane: 1 [0 to 4] at 0 h, 0 [0 to 2] at 48 h, and 1 [0 to 2] at 72 h; rate ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.95 to 1.71]; P = 0.103) or positivity. In one secondary analysis, administrating sevoflurane led to a significant increase in maximal tumor cell counts postoperatively. There was no association between natural killer cell activity and circulating tumor cell counts. Conclusions: In this randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of anesthesia on an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer, there was no difference between sevoflurane and propofol with respect to circulating tumor cell counts over time.

Growing evidence points to its ability to attenuate perioperative immunosuppression of cancers. Abundant studies show that cancer patients who undergo perioperative PPA exhibit less recurrence as well as metastasis. Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-induced death in women. Over the last decades, increasing concerns have been put on the promotional role of PPA in the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Among them, PPA participates in several bioprocesses in the development of breast cancer, including inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activity, elevating serum concentration of nitric oxide index (NOx), depression of the neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1 (NET1) signal pathway, blocking the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway following an decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), increasing NK cytotoxicity, and affecting transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-targeted ras and HER2/neu gene pathways. In this review, we discuss the effect of PPA on breast cancer metastasis and progression. This will provide an alteration pattern of surgical anesthesia technique in breast cancer patients with poor prognosis. © 2015, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).","Breast cancer;

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprised a tiny fraction of tumor bulk and played a vital role in cancer recurrence and eventual mortality. This study investigates the effect of propofol on breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in vitro and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Tumor formation of CSCs was measured by mammosphere culture. Cultured BCSCs were exposed to different concentrations and durations of propofol. Cell proliferation and self-renewal capacity were determined by MTT assays. Expressions of PD-L1 and Nanog were measured using western blotting and real-time PCR. We knocked down the PD-L1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells by lentivirus-mediated RNAi technique, and the mammosphere-forming ability of shControl and shPD-L1 under propofol treatment was examined. Mammosphere culture could enrich BCSCs. Compared with control, cells exposed to propofol for 24 h induced a larger number of mammosphere cells (P=0.0072). Levels of PD-L1 and Nanog were downregulated by propofol. Compared with shControl stem cells, there was no significant difference in the inhibitory effect of propofol on the mammosphere-forming ability of shPD-L1 stem cells which indicated that the inhibition of propofol could disappear in PD-L1 knockdown breast stem cells. Propofol could reduce the mammosphere-forming ability of BCSCs in vitro. Mechanism experiments indicated that the inhibition of propofol in mammosphere formation of BCSCs might be mediated through PD-L1, which was important to maintain Nanog. © 2019 Xiaobei Zhang et al.","","Cells; Cytology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Formation; Forming; Inhibition; Tumors; B7-H1 Antigen; Breast Neoplasms; Down-Regulation; Female; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Nanog Homeobox Protein; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Propofol; RNA, Small Interfering; Spheroids, Cellular; Cell proliferation; Cytology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Polymerase chain reaction; Tumors; messenger RNA; microsphere; Notch receptor; octamer transcription factor 4; programmed death 1 ligand 1; propofol; transcription factor NANOG; transcription factor Sox2; Wnt protein; CD274 protein, human; NANOG protein, human; programmed death 1 ligand 1; propofol; small interfering RNA; transcription factor NANOG; Cancer recurrence; Cancer stem cells; Inhibitory effect; Intravenous anesthesias; Mda-mb-231 cells; Molecular mechanism; Tumor formation; Western blotting; adherent cell; Article; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; MCF-7 cell line; microtubule; MTT assay; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; self concept; Western blotting; breast tumor; cancer stem cell; drug effect; female; metabolism; multicellular spheroid; pathology; Stem cells","","propofol, 2078-54-8; B7-H1 Antigen, ; CD274 protein, human, ; Nanog Homeobox Protein, ; NANOG protein, human, ; Propofol, ; RNA, Small Interfering, ","","","Science Foundation of Tianjin Medical University, (2015KYZQ18); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81702623)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 81702623) and the Science Foundation of Tianjin Medical University (Grant no. 2015KYZQ18).","Luo X., Zhao H., Hennah L., Et al., Impact of isoflurane on malignant capability of ovarian cancer in vitro, British Journal of Anaesthesia, 114, 5, pp. 831-839, (2015); Boland J.W., Ziegler L., Boland E.G., McDermid K., Bennett M.I., Is regular systemic opioid analgesia associated with shorter survival in adult patients with cancer?

Here we aim to explore the immunomodulatory roles of two common anesthetics, propofol and sevoflurane in breast cancer progression. Methods: On murine 4T1 breast cancer models, we isolated immune cells from peripheral blood after treatment with propofol and sevoflurane during tumor resection. The CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression of these immune cells were compared using flow cytometry to determine which immune cells were prominently affected by propofol and sevoflurane. Serum cytokine levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Metastases in lung and liver tissues were counted. In MDA-MB-231 tumor models, the cell count of immune cells was determined. The cytotoxicity of T cells and natural killing cells in co-culture after propofol and sevoflurane treatment were determined using the LDH assay. Results: In the 4T1 breast cancer model, T-lymphocytes showed significant cell count reduction. TNF-α was significantly upregulated at 3 and 24 h after treatment, while IL-2 and IFN-γ showed transient upregulation at 3 h after treatment. Propofol and sevoflurane increased the number of metastases in the lung and liver after primary tumor resection. In the MDA-MB-231 tumor model, CD3 and CD4 cells were also prominently reduced by propofol and sevoflurane treatment. In vitro, the proliferation and cell-killing activity of T cells and NK cells were also attenuated. Conclusions: Propofol and sevoflurane had significant effects in modulating cancer progression through their immunosuppressive role. The proliferation and killing activity of anti-tumor immune cells can be suppressed by propofol and sevoflurane. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anti-tumor; breast cancer; immune regulation; Propofol; sevoflurane","Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Methyl Ethers; Mice; Propofol; Sevoflurane; CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; interleukin 2; propofol; sevoflurane; tumor necrosis factor; dimethyl ether; sevoflurane; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen expression; Article; breast cancer; cancer surgery; cell count; cell isolation; cell killing; cell proliferation; coculture; controlled study; cytokine release; cytotoxicity; female; flow cytometry; human; human cell; immunocompetent cell; immunomodulation; in vitro study; liver metastasis; liver tissue; lung metastasis; lung parenchyma; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; protein blood level; T lymphocyte; upregulation; animal; breast tumor; disease model; pathology","","interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; propofol, 2078-54-8; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; dimethyl ether, 115-10-6; Methyl Ethers, ; Propofol, ; Sevoflurane, ","","","","","DeSantis C.E., Ma J., Gaudet M.M., Et al., Breast cancer statistics, 2019, CA Cancer J Clin, 69, 6, pp. 438-451, (2019); Freeman J., Crowley P.D., Foley A.G., Et al., Effect of perioperative lidocaine, propofol and steroids on pulmonary metastasis in a murine model of breast cancer surgery, Cancers, 11, 5, (2019); An S., Does infiltrative anesthesia improve post-operative morbidity after axillary lymph node dissection in patients of breast cancer?

However, the mechanisms underlying the antitumor are not known. A recent report has found that propofol could significantly downregulate miR-24 expression in the human malignant cancers. In breast cancer cells, overexpression of miR-24 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis by downregulation of p27. The miR-24 has been reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer and breast cancer cell lines. In the present study, we hypothesized that propofol induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells by miR-24/p27 signal pathway. METHODS: Breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells were exposed to propofol (10 μM) for 6 hr and cell death was assessed using TUNEL staining, Flow cytometry and cleaved caspase-3 expression. microRNA-24 (miR-24) expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). miR-24 was overexpressed using a miR-24 mimic. P27 was knocked down using a small interfering RNA. p27 and cleaved caspase-3 expression was assessed by Western blot. RESULTS: MDA-MB-435 exposed to propofol showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells, followed by the downregulation of miR-24, upregulation of p27 expression and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Targeting p27 inhibits propofol-induced cell apoptosis; miR-24 overexpression decreased propofol-induced cell apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3 and p27 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol inducescell death in MDA-MB-435 cells via inactivation of miR-24/p27 signal pathway. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

The anesthetic technique has recently been implicated in impacting long-term cancer outcomes, possibly through modulation of adrenergic-inflammatory responses that impact cancer cell behavior and immune cell function. Emerging evidence suggests that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) may be beneficial for long-term cancer outcomes when compared to inhaled volatile anesthesia. However, the available clinical findings are inconsistent. Preclinical studies that identify the underlying mechanisms involved are critically needed to guide the design of clinical studies that will expedite insight. Most preclinical models of anesthesia have been extrapolated from the use of anesthesia in in vivo research and are not optimally designed to study the impact of anesthesia itself as the primary endpoint. This paper describes a method for delivering propofol-TIVA anesthesia in a mouse model of breast cancer resection that replicates key aspects of clinical delivery in cancer patients. The model can be used to study mechanisms of action of anesthesia on cancer outcomes in diverse cancer types and can be extrapolated to other non-cancer areas of preclinical anesthesia research. © 2021 JoVE Journal of Visualized Experiments.","","Anesthesia, General; Anesthesia, Intravenous; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Mice; Propofol; intravenous anesthetic agent; propofol; animal; breast tumor; female; general anesthesia; human; intravenous anesthesia; mouse","","propofol, 2078-54-8; Anesthetics, Intravenous, ; Propofol, ","","","Cancer Neural-Immune Laboratory; Cancer Therapeutics; Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Clinical Trial Center, China Medical University Hospital, CTC, CMUH; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (1147498); National Breast Cancer Foundation, NBCF, (IIRS-20-025); Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, ANZCA; Monash University, MU","The authors wish to thank members of the Cancer Neural-Immune Laboratory and Dr. Cameron Nowell at Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville.

The inhibitory effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on cancer development and progression are supported by studies with cultured cells and animal models. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is the most extensively used general anesthetic-sedative agent employed today and is nontoxic to humans at high levels (50 μg/ml). Clinically relevant concentrations of propofol (3 to 8 μg/ml; 20 to 50 μM) have also been reported to have anticancer activities. The present study describes the synthesis, purification, characterization and evaluation of two novel anticancer conjugates, propofol-docosahexaenoate (propofol-DHA) and propofol-eicosapentaenoate (propofol-EPA). Methods: The conjugates linking an omega-3 fatty acid, either DHA or EPA, with propofol were synthesized and tested for their effects on migration, adhesion and apoptosis on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Results: At low concentrations (25 μM), DHA, EPA or propofol alone or in combination had minimal effect on cell adhesion to vitronectin, cell migration against serum and the induction of apoptosis (only 5 to 15% of the cells became apoptotic). In contrast, the propofol-DHA or propofol-EPA conjugates significantly inhibited cell adhesion (15 to 30%) and migration (about 50%) and induced apoptosis (about 40%) in breast cancer cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that the novel propofol-DHA and propofol-EPA conjugates reported here may be useful for the treatment of breast cancer. © 2005 Siddiqui et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Antineoplastic Agents;

Rigid bronchoscopy is typically performed under general anesthesia because of the strong stimulation caused by metal instruments. Anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy is challenging to administer because anesthesiologists and interventionists share the same working channel: the airway. Previously reviewed anesthetic methods are used primarily for short procedures. Balanced anesthesia with ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) block and total intravenous anesthesia might provide anesthesia for a prolonged procedure and facilitate patient recovery.Patient concerns:A patient with obstructed endobronchial stent was referred for therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy, which requires deeper anesthesia than flexible bronchoscopy. There were concerns of the stronger stimulation of the rigid bronchoscopy, lengthy duration of the procedure, higher risk of hypoxemia, and the difficulty of mechanical ventilation weaning after anesthesia due to the patients co-morbidities.Diagnosis:A 66-year-old female patient presented with a history of breast cancer with lung metastases. Right main bronchus obstruction due to external compression of lung metastases was relieved through insertion of an endobronchial stent, but obstructive granulation developed after 4 months. Presence of the malfunctioning stent caused severe cough and discomfort. Removal of the stent by using a flexible bronchoscope was attempted twice but failed.Interventions:Regional anesthesia of the upper airway through ultrasound-guided SLN block combined with intratracheal 2% lidocaine spray was performed to assist in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) during rigid bronchoscopy.Outcomes:The patient maintained steady spontaneous breathing throughout the procedure without laryngospasm, bucking, or desaturation. Emergence from anesthesia was smooth and rapid after propofol infusion was discontinued. The surgery lasted 2.5 hours without discontinuity, and no perioperative pulmonary or cardiovascular complications were noted.Conclusion:Ultrasound-guided SLN block is a simple technique with a high success rate and low complication rate. Application of SLN block to assist TIVA provides sufficient anesthesia for lengthened therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without interruption and facilitates patient recovery.

Methods: Venous blood samples were collected after inducing anaesthesia and at 1 and 24 h postoperatively in patients who had undergone breast cancer surgery. The patients were allocated randomly to the propofol- or sevoflurane-based anaesthesia groups. We counted and detected apoptosis in cancer cell, NK cell and CTL of patients with breast cancer by co-culture with a breast cancer cell line in both groups. We also evaluated changes in the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 during the perioperative period. Results: Forty-four patients were included in the final analysis. No difference in NK cell count, CTL count or apoptosis rate was detected between the groups. Furthermore, the number of breast cancer cells undergoing apoptosis in the breast cancer cell co-cultures was not different between the groups. No changes in cytokines were detected between the groups. Conclusion: Although basic science studies have suggested the potential benefits of propofol over a volatile agent during cancer surgery, propofol was not superior to sevoflurane, on the aspects of NK and CTL cells counts with apoptosis rate including breast cancer cell, during anaesthesia for breast cancer surgery in a clinical environment. © 2018 The Author(s).","Breast cancer;

Breast and lung cancers are two malignant thoracic tumors in which the abnormal expression of miRNAs plays a significant role in their development. Phospha-tase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor‐suppressor factor that is capable of suppressing the growth, viability, and metastasis of cancer cells via downregulating phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. PTEN downregulation occurs in lung and breast cancers to promote PI3K/Akt expression, leading to uncontrolled proliferation, metastasis, and their resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. miRNAs as upstream mediators of PTEN can dually induce/in-hibit PTEN signaling in affecting the malignant behavior of lung and breast cancer cells. Further-more, long non‐coding RNAs and circular RNAs can regulate the miRNA/PTEN axis in lung and breast cancer cells. It seems that anti‐tumor compounds such as baicalein, propofol, and curcumin can induce PTEN upregulation by affecting miRNAs in suppressing breast and lung cancer progression. These topics are discussed in the current review with a focus on molecular pathways. © 2021 by the authors.

We evaluated the effect of propofol and desflurane anesthesia on the surgery-induced immune perturbation in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol (n = 20) or desflurane (n = 20) anesthesia. The total and differential white blood cell counts were determined with lymphocyte subpopulations before and 1 hr after anesthesia induction and at 24 hr postoperatively. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 were also measured. Both propofol and desflurane anesthesia preserved the IL-2/IL-4 and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. Leukocytes were lower in the propofol group than in the desflurane group at 1 hr after induction (median [quartiles], 4.98 [3.87-6.31] vs. 5.84 [5.18-7.94] 103/μL) and 24 hr postoperatively (6.92 [5.54-6.86] vs. 7.62 [6.22-9.21] 103/μL). NK cells significantly decreased 1 hr after induction in the propofol group (0.41 [0.34-0.53] to 0.25 [0.21-0.33] 103/μL), but not in the desflurane group (0.33 [0.29-0.48] to 0.38 [0.30-0.56] 103/μL). Our findings indicate that both propofol and desflurane anesthesia for breast cancer surgery induce a favorable immune response in terms of preservation of IL-2/IL-4 and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in the perioperative period. With respect to leukocytes and NK cells, desflurane anesthesia is associated with less adverse immune responses than propofol anesthesia during surgery for breast cancer. © 2015 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","Breast neoplasms;

Materials and Methods: The chemical structure of the synthesized conjugate was characterized by spectroscopic studies. Its anticancer potential was evaluated on the basis of growth inhibition, cancer cell adhesion and migration and apoptosis induction. Results: Propofol stearate exhibited significant (p<0.05) growth inhibition of breast cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. MDA-MB-231 cells showed highest susceptibility towards the inhibitory effect of the conjugate. Moreover, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells with 25 μM propofol stearate potentially suppressed their adhesion (~34%) and migration (~41%), and induced apoptosis (~25%). Conclusion: Exogenously-Applied stearic acid as an ester derivative, inhibits the growth of human breast cancer cells and shows a beneficial role in the treatment of breast cancer, in vitro.","Anticancer agent; Cancer cell lines; Cytotoxicity; Ester conjugate; Fatty acid; MCF-7; MDA-MB-231; MDA-MB-361","Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Drug Design; Esters; Female; Humans; Propofol; Stearates; Stearic Acids; anticancer agent; cancer cell lines; cytotoxicity; Ester conjugate; fatty acid; MCF-7; MDA-MB-231; MDA-MB-361; antineoplastic agent; ester derivative; propofol; stearic acid; antineoplastic agent; drug derivative; ester; fatty acid; propofol; propofol stearate; stearic acid; stearic acid derivative; MLCS; MLOWN; apoptosis; article; breast cancer; cancer cell culture; cancer susceptibility; cell adhesion; cell assay; cell migration; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug design; drug efficacy; drug inhibition; drug purification; drug synthesis; growth inhibition; human; human cell; human cell culture; immunoblotting; in vitro study; priority journal; spectroscopy; breast tumor; cancer cell lines; cell motion; cell proliferation; chemistry; cytotoxicity; drug effect; Ester conjugate; female; MCF-7; MDA-MB-231; MDA-MB-361; synthesis; tumor cell line","","propofol, 2078-54-8; stearic acid, 57-11-4, 646-29-7; Antineoplastic Agents, ; Esters, ; Propofol, 2078-54-8, 4ELV7Z65AP; propofol stearate, ; Stearates, ; stearic acid, 4ELV7Z65AP; Stearic Acids, ","","","","","Miller C.R., McLeod H.L., Pharmacogenomics of cancer chemotherapy-induced toxicity, J Support Oncol, 5, 1, pp. 9-14, (2007); James S.E., Burden H., Burgess R., Xie Y., Yang T., Massa S.M., Longo F.M., Lu Q., Anticancer drug-induced neurotoxicity and identification of rho pathway signaling modulators as potential neuroprotectants, Neurotoxicol, 29, 4, pp. 605-612, (2008); Prentice R.L., Pepe M., Self S.G., Dietary fat and breast cancer: A quantitative assessment of the epidemiological literature and a discussion of methodological issues, Cancer Res, 49, pp. 3147-3156, (1989); Rose D.P., Connolly J.M., Omega-3 fatty acids as cancer chemopreventive agents, Pharmacol Ther, 83, pp. 217-244, (1999); Nkondjock A., Shatenstein B., Maisonneuve P., Ghadirian P., Specific fatty acids and human colorectal cancer: An overview, Cancer Detect Prev, 27, pp. 55-66, (2003); Reddy B.S., Sugie S., Effect of different levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis in f344 rats, Cancer Res, 48, pp. 6642-6647, (1988); Welsch C.W., O'Connor D.H., Influence of the type of dietary fat on developmental growth of the mammary gland in immature and mature female balb/c mice, Cancer Res, 49, pp. 5999-6007, (1989); Rose D.P., Connolly J.M., Effects of fatty acids and inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line in culture, Cancer Res, 50, pp. 7139-7144, (1990); Welsch C.W., Relationship between dietary fat and experimental mammary tumorigenesis: A review and critique, Cancer Res, 52, (1992); Lee M.M., Lin S.S., Dietary fat and breast cancer, Ann Rev Nutr, 20, pp. 221-48, (2000); Wickramasinghe N.S., Jo H., McDonald J.M., Hardy R.W., Stearate inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation.

Here we show that surgical dissection of primary tumors in mice under anesthesia with sevoflurane leads to significantly more lung metastasis than with propofol in both syngeneic murine 4T1 and xenograft human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer models. Sevoflurane increases the level of serum IL-6, which activates STAT3 and the infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid cells into the lung. Interruption of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway by a JAK inhibitor AZD1480 reverses the pro-metastatic effect of sevoflurane and the associated increase of both activated STAT3 and infiltrated CD11b+ cells in 4T1 model. Our study provides the preclinical evidence informing the distinct effects of anesthetics on metastasis of breast cancers through change of cytokines and the tumor microenvironment. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Anesthetics, General; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinases; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Propofol; Sevoflurane; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Murinae; Mus; 5 chloro n2 [1 (5 fluoro 2 pyrimidinyl)ethyl] n4 (5 methyl 1h pyrazol 3 yl) 2,4 pyrimidinediamine; anesthetic agent; CD11b antigen; interleukin 6; propofol; sevoflurane; anesthetic agent; interleukin 6; Janus kinase; propofol; sevoflurane; STAT3 protein; cancer; cell; inhibition; inhibitor; model; rodent; serum; tumor; 4T1 cell line; anesthesia; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioluminescence; bone marrow cell; cancer infiltration; cancer mortality; cancer surgery; comparative study; controlled study; cytokine release; disease association; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; histology; immunofluorescence test; isograft; JAK-STAT signaling; lung metastasis; lung parenchyma; mastectomy; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mouse; nonhuman; protein microarray; protein phosphorylation; tumor microenvironment; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; breast tumor; disease model; genetics; human; lung tumor; metabolism; pathology; tumor cell line","","5 chloro n2 [1 (5 fluoro 2 pyrimidinyl)ethyl] n4 (5 methyl 1h pyrazol 3 yl) 2,4 pyrimidinediamine, 935666-88-9; propofol, 2078-54-8; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; Janus kinase, 161384-16-3; Anesthetics, General, ; Interleukin-6, ; Janus Kinases, ; Propofol, ; Sevoflurane, ; STAT3 Transcription Factor, ","","","NYS; New York State Department of Health, NYSDOH, (DOH01-C33915GG); Stony Brook University, SBU, (56562)","We sincerely appreciate Dr. Chia-Hsin Chan (Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, 11794, USA) for providing 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing firefly.

Surgery is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studies suggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery may influence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here we review the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, the immune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics have different effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reduce the development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery. Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, the evidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofol combined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affects the breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospective studies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existing evidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affects cancer cells and the immune system. © 2018 The Author(s).","Breast Cancer; Migration; Natural killer cell; Proliferation;

Methods: This single center, retrospective study, included patients who received either sevoflurane or propofol during primary breast cancer surgery between 2008 and 2012. Our primary outcome was recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 1 year. Recurrence was defined as locoregional recurrence and distal metastasis. Propensity scores were calculated using seven variables (age, sex, body mass index, cancer stage, tumor size, intrinsic subtype, and deviation from standard therapy), and Kaplan–Meier survival curves were constructed from the date of diagnosis of recurrence. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using univariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: Two-hundred-twelve patients received sevoflurane and 814 patients received total intravenous anesthesia with propofol. The median follow-up was 59 (interquartile range, 44–75) months. Regional anesthetic techniques were not used. Recurrence occurred in 95 patients (9.26%), with 19 (8.96%) and 76 (9.33%) in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively. The HR was 1.167 (95% confidence interval, 0.681–2.000, p = 0.574) for the use of sevoflurane over propofol. After 1:1 propensity-score matching, 318 patients were analyzed. The 1-year RFS rates were similar between the groups (sevoflurane group: 7.5% [n = 12], propofol group: 8.2% [n = 13]), yielding an HR of 1.002 (95% confidence interval 0.457–2.198, p = 0.995) associated with the use of sevoflurane over propofol. Conclusion: In patients undergoing primary breast cancer surgery, the use of either sevoflurane or propofol without regional anesthesia did not appear to affect the risk of recurrence after 1 year. © 2020, Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists.","Breast cancer;

Evidence from recent retrospective clinical analyses suggests that use of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia during cancer resection surgery is associated with improved overall survival compared to inhaled volatile anesthesia. Evaluating these findings in prospective clinical studies is required to inform definitive clinical guidelines but will take many years and requires biomarkers to monitor treatment effect. Therefore, we examined the effect of different anesthetic agents on cancer recurrence in mouse models of breast cancer with the overarching goal of evaluating plausible mechanisms that could be used as biomarkers of treatment response. Methods To test the hypothesis that volatile anesthesia accelerates breast cancer recurrence after surgical resection of the primary tumor, we used three mouse models of breast cancer. We compared volatile sevoflurane anesthesia with intravenous propofol anesthesia and used serial non-invasive bioluminescent imaging to track primary tumor recurrence and metastatic recurrence. To determine short-term perioperative effects, we evaluated the effect of anesthesia on vascular integrity and immune cell changes after surgery in animal models. Results Survival analyses found that the kinetics of cancer recurrence and impact on survival were similar regardless of the anesthetic agent used during cancer surgery. Vascular permeability, immune cell infiltration and cytokine profiles showed no statistical difference after resection with inhaled sevoflurane or intravenous propofol anesthesia. Conclusions These preclinical studies found no evidence that choice of anesthetic agent used during cancer resection surgery affected either short-term perioperative events or long-term cancer outcomes in mouse models of breast cancer. These findings raise the possibility that mouse models do not recapitulate perioperative events in cancer patients. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that future evaluation of effects of anesthesia on cancer outcomes should focus on cancer types other than breast cancer. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

We tested its possible action against HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells that developed resistance against trastuzumab. Cell viability assay, ELISA for cytokines, mammosphere formation, quantitative RT-PCR for EMT/IL-6-targeting miRNAs and the in vivo experimental pulmonary metastasis model were performed to understand the epigenetic action of propofol. Propofol sensitized HER2 overexpressing cells to trastuzumab but such action was even more pronounced in resistant cells. Increased cytokines IL-6 as well as IL-8 were released by resistant cells, along with increased mammospheres and induction of EMT, all of which was inhibited by propofol. IL-6 targeting tumor suppressor miR-149-5p was found to be the novel miRNA that was up-regulated by propofol, resulting in the observed effects on cell viability, IL-6 production, mammospheres generation as well as EMT induction. Further, antagonizing miR-149-5p attenuated the propofol effects confirming the epigenetic activity of propofol through miR-149-5p regulation. Finally, in vivo validation in an experimental metastasis model conformed an inhibitory action of propofol against experimental lung metastasis and the essential mechanistic role of miR-149-5p/IL-6 loop. These results present a novel role of general anesthetic propofol against resistant breast cancer cells and the underlying epigenetic regulation of a tumor suppressor miRNA. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Anesthetics; Animals; Antagomirs; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lung Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Nude; MicroRNAs; Propofol; Receptor, ErbB-2; Transplantation, Heterologous; Trastuzumab; anesthetic agent; antagomir; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; immunological antineoplastic agent; interleukin 6; microRNA; MIRN149 microRNA, human; propofol; trastuzumab; animal; breast tumor; cell survival; drug effect; drug resistance; female; genetic epigenesis; genetics; human; lung tumor; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; xenograft","","epidermal growth factor receptor 2, 137632-09-8; propofol, 2078-54-8; trastuzumab, 180288-69-1, 1446410-98-5; Anesthetics, ; Antagomirs, ; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological, ; Interleukin-6, ; MicroRNAs, ; MIRN149 microRNA, human, ; Propofol, ; Receptor, ErbB-2, ; Trastuzumab, ","","","","","Miner J.R., Burton J.H., Clinical practice advisory: Emergency department procedural sedation with propofol, Ann.

Experimental and, retrospective, clinical data indicate that anaesthetic technique might influence the risk of metastasis after cancer surgery by modulating the immune system. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of perioperative lidocaine injection on immune cells such as T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (NK cells) and the quality of postoperative recovery in breast cancer patients and to propose new ideas and relevant theoretical evidence for the selection of anesthetic protocols for perioperative tumor patients. Methods: Women (n=68) undergoing primary breast tumour resection were randomly assigned to received 2% lidocaine (n=34; group L) or placebo (normal saline; n=34; group S). Venous blood was collected thirty minutes before surgery (T0), after tumor removal (T1), immediately after surgery (T2), 24 h after surgery (T3), and 48 h after surgery (T4). The percentages of NK cells and T lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+) in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry. Patients' quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) scores were recorded by questionnaire before and 24 h after the operation, as well as intraoperative propofol and remifentanil dosages, the frequency of 24 h postoperative remedial analgesia, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and chest tightness. Results: There were 62 patients included in the study, and 60 patients were finally analyzed. The difference in the changing trend of NK cell levels in the 2 groups over time was statistically significant (F=7.675, P=0.008). The intraoperative changing trends of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio over time differed significantly between the 2 groups of patients (P<0.05), whereas the trends of CD8+ T cells did not differ significantly (P>0.05). The QoR-15 score at 24 h after surgery was higher in Group L (128.50±20.25) than in Group S (117.50±19.50), and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.005). No adverse events such as cardiac arrhythmia and lidocaine toxicity occurred in both groups during the perioperative period. Conclusions: Continuous intravenous pumping of lidocaine during the perioperative period has little effect on immune function in breast cancer patients and promotes postoperative recovery.

Neutrophil extracellular trapping (NETosis) is an immunological mechanism strongly linked with increased metastatic risk. Similarly, vascular endothelial growth factor A is linked to angiogenesis implicated in recurrence. Therefore, we investigated the effect of four anaesthetic techniques on NETosis and angiogenic factors expression in women undergoing breast cancer resection. Methods: Women (n=120) undergoing primary breast tumour resection were randomly assigned to receive one of four anaesthetics: sevoflurane (S), sevoflurane plus i.v. lidocaine (SL), propofol (P), and propofol plus i.v. lidocaine (PL). Venous blood was collected before induction and 20–28 h after operation. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histone H3, biomarkers of NETosis, and biomarkers of angiogenesis were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Patient characteristic data and perioperative management did not differ between study groups. The anaesthetic technique including lidocaine decreased expression of citrullinated histone H3 compared with no lidocaine (109 [23] vs 125 [22] ng ml−1, P=0.01 for SL and S and 98 [14] vs 130 [32] mg ml−1, P=0.007, for PL and P, respectively). Similarly, myeloperoxidase was decreased by lidocaine (8.5 [3.4] vs 10.8 [1.8] ng ml−1, P=0.03 for SL and S and 8.6 [3.1] vs 11.6 [2.5] ng ml−1, P=0.01 for PL and P, respectively). Lidocaine also decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) but not MMP9, whichever anaesthetic was used. Vascular endothelial growth factor A concentrations were not significantly influenced by the anaesthetic technique. Conclusions: I.V. perioperative lidocaine decreased postoperative expression of NETosis and MMP3, regardless of general anaesthetic technique. This supports the hypothesis that i.v. lidocaine during cancer surgery of curative intent might reduce recurrence.

It has been reported that propofol has certain anti-breast cancer effects, but the intrinsic molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of propofol on breast cancer MCF-7 cells and its possible regulatory mechanisms. MCF-7 cells were treated by propofol, and then the effects of propofol on cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were studied. We subsequently testified whether miR-21 was a downstream effector of propofol. As a result, propofol repressed the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells, but significantly induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-21 expression and EMT were inhibited by propofol stimulation. The effects of propofol on MCF-7 cells proliferation, apoptosis and EMT were all attenuated when miR-21 was overexpressed. Besides this, the activation of PI3K/AKT and Wnt3a/β-catenin pathways was reduced by propofol stimulation in a miR-21-depedent manner. In conclusion, propofol can inhibit the proliferation and EMT of MCF-7 cells by down-regulating miR-21 expression. Moreover, miR-21 can further regulate PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The anesthetic agents employed during cancer surgery might play a crucial role in cancer cell survival and patient outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the relationship between the type of anesthesia and overall survival in patients who underwent breast cancer surgery performed by one experienced surgeon. Methods All patients who underwent breast cancer surgery by an experienced surgeon between January 2006 and December 2010 were included in this study. Patients were separated into two groups according to the use of desflurane or propofol anesthesia during surgery. Locoregional recurrence and overall survival rates were assessed for the two groups (desflurane or propofol anesthesia). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models and propensity score matching analyses were used to compare the hazard ratios for death and adjust for potential confounders (age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, TNM stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Charlson Comorbidity Index, anesthesiologists, and functional status). Results Of the 976 breast cancer patients, 632 patients underwent breast cancer surgery with desflurane anesthesia, while 344 received propofol anesthesia. After propensity scoring, 592 patients remained in the desflurane group and 296 patients in the propofol group. The mortality rate was similar in the desflurane (38 deaths, 4%) and propofol (22 deaths, 4%; p = 0.812) groups in 5-year follow-up. The crude hazard ratio (HR) for all patients was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–1.92, p = 0.646). No significant difference in the locoregional recurrence or overall 5-year survival rates were found after breast surgery using desflurane or propofol anesthesia (p = 0.454). Propensity score-matched analyses demonstrated similar outcomes in both groups. Patients who received propofol anesthesia had a higher mortality rate than those who received desflurane anesthesia in the matched groups (7% vs 6%, respectively) without significant difference (p = 0.561). In the propensity score-matched analyses, univariable analysis showed an insignificant finding (HR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.72–2.11, p = 0.449). After adjustment for the time since the earliest included patient, the HR remained insignificant (HR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.70–2.16, p = 0.475). Conclusion In our non-randomized retrospective analysis, neither propofol nor desflurane anesthesia for breast cancer surgery by an experienced surgeon can affect patient prognosis and survival. The influence of propofol anesthesia on breast cancer outcome requires further investigation. © 2019 Huang et al.

In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to explore the superior anaesthetic for breast cancer surgery patients. Methods: We searched the Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang databases (up to January, 2021) for RCTs in which inhalational anaesthesia and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia were compared and short-and long-term outcomes were assessed in breast cancer surgical patients. The meta-analysis was performed by Stata 12.0. Results: Twenty RCTs with a total of 2201 patients were included. Compared with inhalational anaesthesia, propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia was associated with more postoperative rescue analgesia (I2=0%, RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.30, P=0.001) but a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (I2=25.5%, RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62–0.81, P<0.001) and postoperative rescue antiemetics (I2=0%, RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.58– 0.82, P<0.001). Propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia preserved nature killer cell cytotoxicity (I2=86.2%, SMD: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.13–1.39, P=0.018), decreased IL-6 level (I2=98.0%, SMD: −3.09, 95% CI: −5.70– −0.48, P=0.021) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (I2=0%, SMD: −0.28, 95% CI: −0.53– −0.03, P=0.030), and increased 2-year recurrence-free survival rate (I2=0%, RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.20, P=0.043) but did not affect recurrence or the overall survival rate (P>0.05). Conclusion: Propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia increases postoperative rescue analgesia but reduces PONV compared with inhalational anaesthesia in breast cancer surgery. The benefit of propofol over inhalational anaesthetics in the preservation of anti-cancer immunity is obvious, but it is difficult to conclude that propofol can exert long-term benefits due to the small sample size. © 2021 Pang et al.","Analgesia; Breast cancer; Inhalational anaesthesia; Outcome; Propofol; Surgery","anesthetic agent; antiemetic agent; inhalation anesthetic agent; opiate; propofol; anesthesia; Article; breast cancer; cancer surgery; comparative study; human; incidence; inhalational drug administration; intravenous anesthesia; meta analysis; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; outcome assessment; overall survival; postoperative analgesia; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence free survival; systematic review; tumor immunity; visual analog scale","","opiate, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4; propofol, 2078-54-8","","","Chongqing Science and health commission medical research project, (2021MSXM001)","Chongqing Science and health commission medical research project, No: 2021MSXM001.","Siegel RL, Miller KD, Jemal A., Cancer statistics 2017, CA Cancer J Clin, 67, 1, pp. 7-30, (2017); Ben-Eliyahu S., The price of anticancer intervention.

Natural killer (NK) T cells are a critical component of the anti-tumour immune response. We investigated the effect of serum from women undergoing primary breast cancer surgery, randomized to propofol-paravertebral block (PPA) or sevoflurane-opioid (GA) anaesthetic techniques, on healthy human donor NK cell function and cytotoxicity against oestrogen and progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer cells (HCC1500). Methods Ten subjects who donated serum before operation and 24 h after operation in an ongoing randomized prospective trial (NCT 00418457) were randomly selected. Serum from PPA (n=5) and GA (n=5) subjects was co-cultured with HCC1500 and healthy primary NK cells. NK cell activating receptors (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, 2b4, CD16, NKG2D), cytokine production, NK CD107a expression, and cytotoxicity towards HCC1500 were examined. Results Serum from PPA subjects did not alter normal NK marker expression or secretion of cytokines. Serum from GA subjects reduced NK cell activating receptor CD16 [from mean (sem), 82 (2)% to 50 (4)%, P=0.001], IL-10 [from 1700 (80) to 1200 (92) pg ml-1, P=0.001], and IL-1β [from 68 (12) to 19 (4) pg ml-1, P=0.01]. An increase in NK cell CD107a [23 (2)% to 37(3)%, P=0.007] and apoptosis of HCC1500 [11 (1)% to 21 (2)%, P=0.0001] was observed with PPA serum, but not GA serum, treated NK cells. Conclusion Serum from women with breast cancer undergoing surgical excision who were randomized to receive a PPA anaesthetic technique led to greater human donor NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro compared with serum from women who received GA.

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that propofol independently reduces migration of cancer cells and metastasis. Thus, the authors retrospectively examined the link between propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and recurrence or overall survival in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Methods: A retrospective analysis of the electronic database of all patients undergoing MRM for breast cancer between January 2007 and December 2008 was undertaken. Patients received either propofol-based TIVA (propofol group) or sevoflurane-based anesthesia (sevoflurane group). We analyzed prognostic factors of breast cancer and perioperative factors and compared recurrence-free survival and overall survival between propofol and sevoflurane groups. Results: A total of 363 MRMs were carried out during the period of the trial; 325 cases were suitable for analysis (173 cases of propofol group, and 152 cases of sevoflurane group). There were insignificant differences between the groups in age, weight, height, histopathologic results, surgical time, or postoperative treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy). The use of opioids during the perioperative period was greater in propofol group than in sevoflurane group. Overall survival was no difference between the two groups. Propofol group showed a lower rate of cancer recurrence (P = 0.037), with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.550 (95% CI 0.311-0.973). Conclusions: This retrospective study provides the possibility that propofol-based TIVA for breast cancer surgery can reduce the risk of recurrence during the initial 5 years after MRM. © the Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2016.","Breast neoplasms; Propofol; Recurrence; Sevoflurane","alfentanil; diclofenac; fentanyl; glycopyrronium bromide; ketorolac; midazolam; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; pethidine; propofol; remifentanil; rocuronium; sevoflurane; thiopental; adult; Article; bispectral index; breast cancer; cancer prognosis; endotracheal intubation; general anesthesia; hemodynamic monitoring; human; intravenous anesthesia; major clinical study; mastectomy; middle aged; modified radical mastectomy; overall survival; perioperative period; propofol based total intravenous anesthesia; recurrence free survival; recurrence risk; retrospective study; risk factor; sevoflurane based anesthesia","","alfentanil, 69049-06-5, 71195-58-9; diclofenac, 15307-79-6, 15307-86-5; fentanyl, 437-38-7; ketorolac, 74103-06-3; midazolam, 59467-70-8; opiate, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4; pethidine, 28097-96-3, 50-13-5, 57-42-1; propofol, 2078-54-8; remifentanil, 132539-07-2; rocuronium, 119302-91-9; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; thiopental, 71-73-8, 76-75-5","","","","","Demicheli R., Retsky M.W., Hrushesky W.J., Baum M., Gukas I.D., The effects of surgery on tumor growth: A century of investigations, Ann Oncol, 19, pp. 1821-1828, (2008); Tsuchiya Y., Sawada S., Yoshioka I., Ohashi Y., Matsuo M., Harimaya Y., Et al., Increased surgical stress promotes tumor metastasis, Surgery, 133, pp. 547-555, (2003); Melamed R., Bar-Yosef S., Shakhar G., Shakhar K., Ben-Eliyahu S., Suppression of natural killer cell activity and promotion of tumor metastasis by ketamine, thiopental, and halothane, but not by propofol: Mediating mechanisms and prophylactic measures, Anesth Analg, 97, pp. 1331-1339, (2003); Lysle D.T., Coussons M.E., Watts V.J., Bennett E.H., Dykstra L.A., Morphine-induced alterations of immune status: Dose dependency, compartment specificity and antagonism by naltrexone, J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 265, pp. 1071-1078, (1993); Page G.G., Blakely W.P., Ben-Eliyahu S., Evidence that postoperative pain is a mediator of the tumor-promoting effects of surgery in rats, Pain, 90, pp. 191-199, (2001); Snyder G.L., Greenberg S., Effect of anesthetic technique and other perioperative factors on cancer recurrence, Br J Anaesth, 105, pp. 106-115, (2010); Ecimovic P., Murray D., Doran P., Buggy D.J., Propofol and bupivacaine in breast cancer cell function in vitro-role of the NET1 gene, Anticancer Res, 34, pp. 1321-1331, (2014); Juneja R., Opioids and cancer recurrence, Curr Opin Support Palliat Care, 8, pp. 91-101, (2014); Shavit Y., Ben-Eliyahu S., Zeidel A., Beilin B., Effects of fentanyl on natural killer cell activity and on resistance to tumor metastasis in rats.

Clinical histological studies demonstrate that the distribution of these immune cells and macrophages in intra-tumoral cancer tissue can predict prognosis and response to therapy. No study has evaluated whether the anaesthetic technique influences human breast cancer immune cell infiltration. Materials and Methods: Excised breast cancer specimens from patients previously enrolled in an ongoing, prospective, randomised trial (NCT00418457) investigating the effect of anaesthetic technique on long-term breast cancer outcome were immu nohistochemically stained to enable a colour deconvolution technique to summate marked immune cell infiltration: CD56 (NK cells), CD4 (T helper cells), CD8 (T suppressor cells) and CD68 (macrophages). Patients were randomised to receive either a propofol-para vertebral anaesthetic with continuing analgesia (PPA, n=12) or a balanced general anaesthesia with opioid analgesia (GA, n=16) for 24 h postoperatively. Investigators were masked to group allocation. Results: Normalised posi tive intensity values, (median (interquartile range (IQR)), for CD56 were lower in GA121 (116-134) versus 136 (132-142), p=0.015. CD4 was also lower in GA10.9 (5.5-27.8) versus PPA 19.7 (14.4-83.5), p=0.03 but CD8 5.5 (4.0-9.75) versus 13.0 (5.0-14.5) respectively, p=0.24 and CD 68 infiltration 5.8 (3.25-8.75) versus 8.0 (3.0-8.75), p=0.74 were not significantly different. Conclusion: PPA induces increased levels of NK and T helper cell infiltration into breast cancer tissue compared with GA but not T suppressor cells or macro phages. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the anaesthetic technique may affect perioperative immune function conducive to resisting breast cancer recurrence and metastasis.","Anaesthetic technique; Breast cancer immune cell infiltration; Randomised grial","Adult; Aged; Anesthesia; Antigens, CD; Antigens, CD56; Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Macrophages; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer; CD4 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD68 antigen; fentanyl; local anesthetic agent; morphine; opiate; propofol; sevoflurane; CD56 antigen; CD68 antigen, human; differentiation antigen; leukocyte antigen; NCAM1 protein, human; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer tissue; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell infiltration; female; follow up; general anesthesia; helper cell; human; human cell; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; immunohistochemistry; macrophage; natural killer cell; pilot study; postoperative period; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); spinal anesthesia; suppressor cell; aged; anesthesia; breast tumor; controlled study; immunology; middle aged; procedures; prospective study; randomized controlled trial","","fentanyl, 437-38-7, 1443-54-5; morphine, 52-26-6, 57-27-2; opiate, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4; propofol, 2078-54-8; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; Antigens, CD, ; Antigens, CD56, ; Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic, ; CD68 antigen, human, ; NCAM1 protein, human, ","","","","","Exadaktylos A.K., Buggy D.J., Moriarty D.C., Mascha E., Sessler D.I., Can anesthetic technique for primary breast cancer surgery affect recurrence or metastasis?, Anesthesiology, 105, 4, pp. 660-664, (2006); Biki B., Mascha E., Moriarty D.C., Fitzpatrick J.M., Sessler D.I., Buggy D.J., Anesthetic technique for radical prostatectomy surgery affects cancer recurrence: A retrospective analysis, Anesthesiology, 109, 2, pp. 180-187, (2008); Wuethrich P.Y., Hsu Schmitz S.F., Kessler T.M., Thalmann G.N., Studer U.E., Stueber F., Burkhard F.C., Potential influence of the anesthetic technique used during open radical prostatectomy on prostate cancer-related outcome: A retrospective study, Anesthesiology, 113, 3, pp. 570-576, (2010); Gupta A., Bjornsson A., Fredriksson M., Hallbook O., Eintrei C., Reduction in mortality after epidural anaesthesia and anal-gesia in patients undergoing rectal but not colonic cancer surgery: A retrospective analysis of data from 655 patients in central Sweden, Br J Anaesth, 107, 2, pp. 164-170, (2011); Lin L., Liu C., Tan H., Ouyang H., Zhang Y., Zeng W., Anaesthetic technique may affect prognosis for ovarian serous adenocarcinoma: A retrospective analysis, Br J Anaesth, 106, 6, pp. 814-822, (2011); De Oliveira G.S., Ahmad S., Schink J.C., Singh D.K., Fitzgerald P.C., McCarthy R.J., Intraoperative neuraxial anesthesia but not postoperative neuraxial analgesia is associated with increased relapse-free survival in ovarian cancer patients after primary cyto-reductive surgery, Reg Anesth Pain Med, 36, 3, pp. 271-277, (2011); Gottschalk A., Brodner G., Van Aken H.K., Ellger B., Althaus S., Schulze H.J., Can regional anaesthesia for lymph-node dissection improve the prognosis in malignant melanoma?, Br J Anaesth, 109, 2, pp. 253-259, (2012); Ismail H., Ho K.M., Narayan K., Kondalsamy-Chennakesavan S., Effect of neuraxial anaesthesia on tumour progression in cervical cancer patients treated with brachy therapy: A retro-spective cohort study, Br J Anaesth, 105, 2, pp. 145-149, (2010); Gottschalk A., Ford J.G., Regelin C.C., You J., Mascha E.J., Sessler D.I., Durieux M.E., Nemergut E.C., Association between epidural analgesia and cancer recurrence after colorectal cancer surgery, Anesthesiology, 113, 1, pp. 27-34, (2010); Lai R., Peng Z., Chen D., Wang X., Xing W., Zeng W., Chen M., The effects of anesthetic technique on cancer recurrence in percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of small hepatocellular carcinoma, Anesth Analg, 114, 2, pp. 290-296, (2012); Day A., Smith R., Jourdan I., Fawcett W., Scott M., Rockall T., Retrospective analysis of the effect of postoperative analgesia on survival in patients after laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer, Br J Anaesth, 109, 2, pp. 185-190, (2012); Myles P.S., Peyton P., Silbert B., Hunt J., Rigg J.R., Sessler D.I., Perioperative epidural anal-gesia for major abdominal surgery for cancer and recurrence-free survival: Randomised trial, BMJ, 342, (2011); Sessler D.I., Ben-Eliyahu S., Mascha E.J., Parat M.O., Buggy D.J., Can regional analgesia reduce the risk of recurrence after breast cancer?

Here, we aim to determine the roles of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in disposition of alpinetin. Glucuronidation potential of alpinetin was evaluated using pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM), pooled human intestine microsomes (pHIM) and expressed UGT enzymes supplemented with the cofactor UDPGA. Activity correlation analyses with a bank of individual HLMs were performed to identify the main contributing UGT isozymes in hepatic glucuronidation of alpinetin. The effect of BCRP on alpinetin disposition was assessed using HeLa cells overexpressing UGT1A1 (HeLa1A1) cells. Alpinetin underwent extensive glucuronidation in pHLM and pHIM, generating one glucuronide metabolite. Of 12 test UGT enzymes, UGT1A3 was the most active one toward alpinetin with an intrinsic clearance (CL                             int                              = V                             max                             /K                             m                             ) value of 66.5 μl/min/nmol, followed by UGT1A1 (CL                             int                              = 48.6 μl/min/nmol), UGT1A9 (CL                             int                              = 21.0 μl/min/nmol), UGT2B15 (CL                             int                              = 16.7 μl/min/nmol) and UGT1A10 (CL                             int                              = 1.60 μl/min/nmol). Glucuronidation of alpinetin was significantly correlated with glucuronidation of estradiol (an activity marker of UGT1A1), chenodeoxycholic acid (an activity marker of UGT1A3), propofol (an activity marker of UGT1A9) and 5-hydroxyrofecoxib (an activity marker of UGT2B15), confirming the important roles of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9 and UGT2B15 in alpinetin glucuronidation. Inhibition of BCRP by its specific inhibitor Ko143 significantly reduced excretion of alpinetin glucuronide, leading to a significant decrease in cellular glucuronidation of alpinetin. Our data suggest UGTs and BCRP as two important determinants of alpinetin pharmacokinetics.                          © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alpinetin; BCRP; efflux transport; Glucuronidation; UGT","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; Flavanones; Glucuronides; Glucuronosyltransferase; HeLa Cells; Humans; Intestines; Kinetics; Microsomes; Microsomes, Liver; Neoplasm Proteins; 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a octahydro 6 isobutyl 9 methoxy 1,4 dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4 b]indole 3 propanoic acid tert butyl ester; alpinetin; breast cancer resistance protein; chenodeoxycholic acid; estradiol; flavonoid; glucuronosyltransferase; glucuronosyltransferase 1A1; glucuronosyltransferase 1A10; glucuronosyltransferase 1A3; glucuronosyltransferase 1A9; glucuronosyltransferase 2B15; natural product; propofol; uridine diphosphate galactose; ABCG2 protein, human; alpinetin; flavanone derivative; glucuronide; glucuronosyltransferase; tumor protein; controlled study; drug disposition; drug excretion; drug glucuronidation; drug identification; drug retention; gene overexpression; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; intrinsic clearance; liver microsome; retention time; ultra performance liquid chromatography; chemistry; intestine; kinetics; metabolism; microsome","","1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a octahydro 6 isobutyl 9 methoxy 1,4 dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4 b]indole 3 propanoic acid tert butyl ester, 461054-93-3; chenodeoxycholic acid, 474-25-9; estradiol, 50-28-2; glucuronosyltransferase, 37329-64-9, 9030-08-4; propofol, 2078-54-8; uridine diphosphate galactose, 2956-16-3; ABCG2 protein, human, ; alpinetin, ; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2, ; Flavanones, ; Glucuronides, ; Glucuronosyltransferase, ; Neoplasm Proteins, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81503210, 81503341, 81573488, 81722049)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81722049, 81573488, 81503341, 81503210).","Boersma M.G., van der Woude H., Bogaards J., Et al., Regioselectivity of phase II metabolism of luteolin and quercetin by UDP-glucuronosyl transferases, Chem Res Toxicol, 15, (2002); Brand W., Boersma M.G., Bik H., Et al., Phase II metabolism of hesperetin by individual UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases and rat and human tissue samples, Drug Metab Dispos, 38, pp. 617-625, (2010); Chen H., Mo X., Yu J., Huang Z., Alpinetin attenuates inflammatory responses by interfering toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide-induced mastitis in mice, Int Immunopharmacol, 17, pp. 26-32, (2013); Costa A., Sarmento B., Seabra V., An evaluation of the latest in vitro tools for drug metabolism studies, Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol, 10, pp. 103-119, (2014); Evans W.E., Relling M.V., Pharmacogenomics: translating functional genomics into rational therapeutics, Science, 286, pp. 487-491, (1999); Galijatovic A., Otake Y., Walle U.K., Walle T., Extensive metabolism of the flavonoid chrysin by human Caco-2 and Hep G2 cells, Xenobiotica, 29, (1999); Ge S., Gao S., Yin T., Hu M., Determination of pharmacokinetics of chrysin and its conjugates in wild-type FVB and Bcrp1 knockout mice using a validated LC-MS/MS method, J Agric Food Chem, 63, pp. 2902-2910, (2015); Guan S., Fang B., Song B., Et al., Immunosuppressive activity of alpinetin on activation and cytokines secretion of murine T lymphocytes, Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol, 36, pp. 290-296, (2014); He X., Wei Z., Wang J., Et al., Alpinetin attenuates inflammatory responses by suppressing TLR4 and NLRP3 signaling pathways in DSS-induced acute colitis, Sci Rep, 6, (2016); Homolya L., Varadi A., Sarkadi B., Multidrug resistance-associated proteins: export pumps for conjugates with glutathione, glucuronate or sulfate, Biofactors, 17, pp. 103-114, (2003); Hsiu S.L., Tsao C.W., Tsai Y.C., Et al., Determinations of morin, quercetin and their conjugate metabolites in serum, Biol Pharm Bull, 24, pp. 967-969, (2001); Ingle J.N., Buzdar A.U., Schaid D.J., Et al., Variation in anastrozole metabolism and pharmacodynamics in women with early breast cancer, Cancer Res, 70, pp. 3278-3286, (2010); Janisch K.M., Williamson G., Needs P., Plumb G.W., Properties of quercetin conjugates: modulation of LDL oxidation and binding to human serum albumin, Free Radic Res, 38, pp. 877-884, (2004); Jiang W., Hu M., Mutual interactions between flavonoids and enzymatic and transporter elements responsible for flavonoid disposition via phase II metabolic pathways, RSC Adv, 2, pp. 7948-7963, (2012); Jiang Z., Sang H., Fu X., Et al., Alpinetin enhances cholesterol efflux and inhibits lipid accumulation in oxidized low-density lipoprotein-loaded human macrophages, Biotechnol Appl Biochem, 62, pp. 840-847, (2015); Kimura Y., Takahashi S., Yoshida I., Studies on the constituents of Alpinia.

Surgical stress and inhalation anesthesia suppress cell-mediated immunity (CMI), whereas intravenous (IV) anesthesia with propofol and regional anesthesia (RA) are known to be protective for CMI. Surgical stress, general anesthesia (GA) with inhalation anesthesia and opioids contribute to perioperative immunosuppression and may increase cancer recurrence and decrease survival. Surgical stress and GA activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and release neuroendocrine mediators such as cortisol, catecholamines, and prostaglandin E2, which may reduce host defense immunity and promote distant metastasis. On the other hand, IV anesthesia with propofol and RA with paravertebral block or epidural anesthesia can weaken surgical stress and GA-induced immunosuppression and protect the host defense immunity. IV anesthesia with propofol and RA or in combination with GA may reduce cancer recurrence and improve patient survival compared to GA alone. We review the current status of the relationship between anesthesia and breast cancer recurrence using retrospective and prospective studies conducted with animal models and clinical samples, and discuss the future prospects for reducing breast cancer recurrence and improving survival rates in breast cancer surgery.

The natural killer (NK) cell is a critical part of anti-tumor immunity. We compared the effects of two different anesthesia and analgesia methods on the NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Methods: Fifty patients undergoing breast cancer resection were randomly assigned to receive propofol-remifentanil anesthesia with postoperative ketorolac analgesia (Propofol-ketorolac groups) or sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia with postoperative fentanyl analgesia (Sevoflurane-fentanyl group). The primary outcome was NKCC, which was measured before and 24 h after surgery. Post-surgical pain scores and inflammatory responses measured by white blood cell, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were assessed. Cancer recurrence or metastasis was evaluated with ultrasound and whole body bone scan every 6 months for 2 years after surgery. Results: The baseline NKCC (%) was comparable between the two groups (P = 0.082). Compared with the baseline value, NKCC (%) increased in the Propofol-ketorolac group [15.2 (3.2) to 20.1 (3.5), P = 0.048], whereas it decreased in the Sevoflurane-fentanyl group [19.5 (2.8) to 16.4 (1.9), P = 0.032]. The change of NKCC over time was significantly different between the groups (P = 0.048). Pain scores during 48 h after surgery and post-surgical inflammatory responses were comparable between the groups. One patient in the Sevoflurane-fentanyl group had recurrence in the contralateral breast and no metastasis was found in either group. Conclusions: Propofol anesthesia with postoperative ketorolac analgesia demonstrated a favorable impact on immune function by preserving NKCC compared with sevoflurane anesthesia and postoperative fentanyl analgesia in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. © Ivyspring International Publisher.","Analgesia; Anesthesia; Breast cancer; Immunity; Natural killer cell","Adult; Aged; Analgesia; Analgesics, Opioid; Anesthesia; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Fentanyl; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Immunocompromised Host; Killer Cells, Natural; Methyl Ethers; Middle Aged; Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Perioperative Care; Piperidines; Propofol; Prospective Studies; fentanyl; glycopyrronium; ketorolac; neostigmine; propofol; ramosetron; remifentanil; rocuronium; sevoflurane; ether derivative; fentanyl; inhalation anesthetic agent; narcotic analgesic agent; piperidine derivative; propofol; remifentanil; sevoflurane; adult; aged; analgesia; anesthesia; Article; bone scintiscanning; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; clinical article; controlled study; echography; female; human; immune deficiency; immunocompromised patient; inflammation; leukocyte count; low drug dose; lymphocyte count; metastasis; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; neutrophil count; outcome assessment; pain assessment; patient monitoring; perioperative period; postoperative analgesia; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative period; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; tumor immunity; analgesia; anesthesia; breast tumor; cellular immunity; drug effect; immunology; middle aged; natural killer cell; pain measurement; pathology; perioperative period; procedures","","fentanyl, 437-38-7; glycopyrronium, 596-51-0, 1624259-25-1, 740028-90-4; ketorolac, 74103-06-3; neostigmine, 114-80-7, 588-17-0, 59-99-4, 8048-84-8; propofol, 2078-54-8; ramosetron, 132036-88-5, 132907-72-3; remifentanil, 132539-07-2; rocuronium, 119302-91-9; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; Analgesics, Opioid, ; Anesthetics, Inhalation, ; Fentanyl, ; Methyl Ethers, ; Piperidines, ; Propofol, ; remifentanil, ; sevoflurane, ","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2014R1A2A2A01007289); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Financial support and sponsorship: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (No. 2014R1A2A2A01007289).","Snyder G.L., Greenberg S., Effect of anaesthetic technique and other perioperative factors on cancer recurrence, Br J Anaesth, 105, pp. 106-115, (2010); Kurosawa S., Anesthesia in patients with cancer disorders, Curr Opin Anaesthesiol, 25, pp. 376-384, (2012); Chester C., Fritsch K., Kohrt H.E., Natural Killer Cell Immunomodulation: Targeting Activating, Inhibitory, and Co-stimulatory Receptor Signaling for Cancer Immunotherapy, Front Immunol, 6, (2015); Konjevic G., Spuzic I., Stage dependence of NK cell activity and its modulation by interleukin 2 in patients with breast cancer, Neoplasma., 40, pp. 81-85, (1993); Liljefors M., Nilsson B., Hjelm Skog A.L., Et al., Natural killer (NK) cell function is a strong prognostic factor in colorectal carcinoma patients treated with the monoclonal antibody 17-1A, Int J Cancer, 105, pp. 717-723, (2003); Pasero C., Gravis G., Granjeaud S., Et al., Highly effective NK cells are associated with good prognosis in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, Oncotarget, 6, pp. 14360-14373, (2015); Pirbudak Cocelli L., Ugur M.G., Karadasli H., Comparison of effects of low-flow sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia on neutrophil and T-cell populations, Curr Ther Res Clin Exp, 73, pp. 41-51, (2012); Melamed R., Bar-Yosef S., Shakhar G., Shakhar K., Ben-Eliyahu S., Suppression of natural killer cell activity and promotion of tumor metastasis by ketamine, thiopental, and halothane, but not by propofol: Mediating mechanisms and prophylactic measures, Anesth Analg, 97, pp. 1331-1339, (2003); Shavit Y., Ben-Eliyahu S., Zeidel A., Beilin B., Effects of fentanyl on natural killer cell activity and on resistance to tumor metastasis in rats.

It has been recently revealed that propofol has anticancer properties including direct and indirect suppression of the viability and proliferation of cancer cells by promoting apoptosis in some cancer cell lines. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study aimed to establish a profile to quantitatively and functionally evaluate the anticancer properties of propofol in three cancer cell lines: non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line A549, human colon carcinoma cell line LoVo, and human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3. We demonstrated that the expression level of caspase-3, an apoptosis biomarker, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after 24-h stimulation with 100 μM propofol in A549 cells, and slightly increased in LoVo cells. However, there was no change in caspase-3 expression in SK-BR-3 cells. High caspase-3 expression in A549 cells may be modulated by the ERK1/2 pathway because phosphorylated ERK1/2 dramatically reduced after propofol treatment. BAX, a major protein that promotes apoptosis in the regulation phase, was highly expressed in A549 cells after treatment with 25 μM propofol. Apoptosis induced by propofol may be associated with cancer cells carrying Kras mutations. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that the anti-cancer effects of propofol, which are consistent with those of previous studies, are likely associated with the Kras mutation status. Only Kras mutation in Codon 12 instead of other Kras status has been demonstrated to play an important role in sensitizing the propofol-induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines from our study. These findings may enable us a detailed investigation of propofol/Kras-mediated cancer cell apoptosis in the future. © 2014 Song et al.","","Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; bcl-2-Associated X Protein;

Periop-erative and postoperative period is associated with impaired immune function that can have profound implications for cancer patients in terms of tumor recurrence and metastases. The three main factors include surgery and related neuroendocrine stress response, anesthetic drugs, including opioid analge-sics and postoperative pain. The most investigated immune cells are natural killer (NK) cells that are affected by both anesthesia and surgery. It has been demonstrated that ketamine, thiopental, volatile anesthetics, fentanyl and morphine, but not propofol, remifentanil or tramadol reduce the number of circulating NK cells and depress their toxicity. The level of NK cells’ cytotoxicity is inversely pro-portional to the stage and spread of cancer. Regional anesthesia and its potential beneficial effects on the perioperative immune response and long-term outcome after surgery has been investigated as an alternative to general anesthesia in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. In this paper, we present a review of literature aimed to assess the impact of regional anesthesia techniques on the immune response in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery and how it compares to general anesthesia. © 2022, Dr. Mladen Stojanovic University Hospital.

We compared total intravenous anesthesia and balanced anesthesia with volatile agents to investigate the differences in their effects on recurrence-free survival and overall survival after breast cancer surgery. Materials and Methods: The electronic medical records of 2,729 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery between November 2005 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed to analyze the factors associated with recurrencefree survival after surgery. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the risk factors for cancer recurrence and overall mortality after breast cancer surgery. Results: Data from 2,645 patients were finally analyzed. The recurrence-free survival rate in this study was 91.2%. Tumor-node-metastasis staging exhibited the strongest association with breast cancer recurrence. However, we were unable to identify significant differences between the preventive effects of total intravenous anesthesia and those of volatile agents on postoperative breast cancer recurrence using Cox regression analyses and propensity score matching. Furthermore, the survival probability with regard to postoperative recurrence and mortality showed no significant differences among anesthetic agents. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the effects of total intravenous anesthesia are comparable with those of volatile agents with regard to postoperative recurrencefree survival and overall survival in patients with breast cancer. © Kim et al.","Anesthesia; Breast cancer; Propofol; Recurrence; Volatile agent","atracurium besilate; desflurane; enflurane; isoflurane; propofol; remifentanil; rocuronium; sevoflurane; thiopental; vecuronium; adult; aged; Article; balanced anesthesia; breast cancer; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer surgery; disease association; female; human; intravenous anesthesia; major clinical study; overall survival; postoperative period; recurrence free survival; retrospective study","","atracurium besilate, 64228-79-1, 64228-81-5; desflurane, 57041-67-5; enflurane, 13838-16-9; isoflurane, 26675-46-7; propofol, 2078-54-8; remifentanil, 132539-07-2; rocuronium, 119302-91-9; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; thiopental, 71-73-8, 76-75-5; vecuronium, 50700-72-6","","","","","Brand J.M., Kirchner H., Poppe C., Schmucker P., The effects of general anesthesia on human peripheral immune cell distribution and cytokine production, Clin Immunol Immunopathol, 83, pp. 190-194, (1997); Ben-Eliyahu S., Page G.G., Yirmiya R., Shakhar G., Evidence that stress and surgical interventions promote tumor development by suppressing natural killer cell activity, Int J Cancer, 80, pp. 880-888, (1999); Gottschalk A., Sharma S., Ford J., Durieux M.E., Tiouririne M., Review article: the role of the perioperative period in recurrence after cancer surgery, Anesth Analg, 110, pp. 1636-1643, (2010); Melamed R., Bar-Yosef S., Shakhar G., Shakhar K., Ben-Eliyahu S., Suppression of natural killer cell activity and promotion of tumor metastasis by ketamine, thiopental, and halothane, but not by propofol: mediating mechanisms and prophylactic measures, Anesth Analg, 97, pp. 1331-1339, (2003); Sofra M., Fei P.C., Fabrizi L., Marcelli M.E., Claroni C., Gallucci M., Ensoli F., Forastiere E., Immunomodulatory effects of total intravenous and balanced inhalation anesthesia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing elective radical cystectomy: preliminary results, J Exp Clin Cancer Res, 32, (2013); Patrice F., Julie V., Martine B., Jean-Pascal M., Benoit N., Catherine L., Marc De K., Do Intraoperative Analgesics Influence Breast Cancer Recurrence After Mastectomy?.

Neutrophil Extracellular Trapping (NETosis) is an immunological process, whereby neutrophils engulf tumour antigen then degranulate, leaving a serologic marker. NETosis expression among breast cancer patients is associated with an increased risk of metastasis. We investigated the effect of two distinct anaesthetic techniques on the expression of NETosis in women who underwent potentially curative breast cancer surgery. Methods: In a parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, a subset of women (n = 40) undergoing breast cancer resection surgery, who were partaking in a larger trial (NCT00418457), were randomly assigned to receive volatile general anaesthesia (GA) or propofol GA combined with paravertebral regional anaesthesia (PPA) for their surgery. Serum was taken and stored before and 24 hours post-operatively. NETosis was measured by ELISA using Neutrophil Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) biomarkers, which were the co-primary end points. Results: Patient and breast cancer characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Recurrence occurred in 7.5% patients. GA patients received more opioids and reported higher post-operative pain than PPA. There was no difference in post-operative MPO in GA vs PPA (10.5 ± 6.6 vs 11.5 ± 4.7 ng mL−1, P =.60). Regarding CitH3, there was no difference post-operatively in GA vs PPA (3.6 ± 2.3 vs 4.0 ± 5.9, P =.80). NET expression did not differ before or after anaesthesia and surgery in either group, for either biomarker. Conclusion: Anaesthetic technique did not affect NETosis expression in breast cancer patients, indicating that it is not a viable marker of the effect of anaesthetic technique on breast cancer recurrence. © 2020 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

However, they differ in their side effect and complications profile. With the increase in the incidence and detection of breast cancer, evidence is accumulating towards the choice of anaesthetic technique affecting its recurrence and metastasis rate. This review aims to address the role of the anaesthesiologist in modern day breast cancer surgery, with focus on measures to reduce its recurrence and achieving peri-operative patient safety for primary, robotic and reconstructive breast cancer surgery. It also highlights the recent paradigm shift from general opioid-based anaesthesia to regional anaesthesia, based on prospective animal and retrospective human studies. The authors recommend the combination of total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and regional anaesthesia (especially the newer PECS blocks) but not inhalation anaesthesia with morphine for the patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery.

Methods: The expression of miR-21 in breast cancer cells was examined by TCGA database analysis and real-time quantitative PCR. After overexpressed or knocked out miR-21 in breast cancer cells, the effect of miR-21 on the proliferation of breast cancer cells was measured by CCK-8 method. The effect of miR-21 on EMT expression in breast cancer cells was detected using Western blot and immunofluorescence staining, and the cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: It was confirmed that miR-21 was a downstream effector of propofol. Propofol inhibited the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells and significantly induced cell apoptosis. At the same time, propofol stimulated and inhibited miR-21 expression and EMT. When miR-21 was overexpressed, its effects on proliferation and apoptosis of MCF-7 cells as well as EMT were all attenuated. Furthermore, when propofol stimulated miR-21-depedent, the activation ofPI3K/AKT and Wnt3a/b-catenin pathways was reduced. Conclusion: Propofol inhibits MCF-7 cells proliferation and EMT by down-regulating the expression of miR-21. In addition, miR-21 can further regulate the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/b-catenin pathways. © 2019 A. CARBONE Editore.

Apoptosis is an important step in the mechanism of breast cancer metastasis, but whether it is influenced by anaesthetic technique is unknown. Using serum from breast cancer surgery patients randomized to receive distinct anaesthetic techniques, we investigated its effect on apoptosis in oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells in vitro. Methods Women with biopsy-proven breast cancer were randomized to receive either propofol general anaesthesia with paravertebral analgesia (PPA) or standard sevoflurane general anaesthesia with opioid analgesia (SGA) in an ongoing, prospective clinical trial (NCT 00418457). Serum from a randomly selected subset of these patients (10 PPA and 10 SGA) who had donated 20 ml venous blood immediately before anaesthetic induction and at 1 h after operation was exposed to ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptosis was measured using ApoLive-Glo Multiplex Assay™. Results Exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to postoperative serum of PPA patients resulted in higher luminescence ratio (apoptosis) than SGA patients, median (25-75%), 0.40 (0.35-0.43) compared with 0.22 (0.21-0.30), respectively (P=0.001). The luminescence ratio of postoperative serum from SGA was reduced compared with preoperative SGA 0.22 (0.21-0.30) compared with 0.3 (0.25-0.35) (P=0.045). Conclusions Serum from patients given sevoflurane anaesthesia and opioids for primary breast cancer surgery reduces apoptosis in ER-negative breast cancer cells to a greater extent than serum from patients given propofol-paravertebral anaesthesia. Anaesthetic technique might affect the serum milieu in a manner that impacts cancer cell apoptosis, and thereby tumour metastasis. © 2014 The Author.","anaesthesia general; anaesthesia paravertebral; anaesthesia regional; apoptosis; breast cancer","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analgesics, Opioid; Anesthesia, General; Anesthesia, Spinal; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Mastectomy; Methyl Ethers; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Postoperative Period; Propofol; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Young Adult; anaesthesia, general; anaesthesia, paravertebral; anaesthesia, regional; apoptosis; breast cancer; anesthetic agent; diprifusor; estrogen receptor; fentanyl; levobupivacaine; morphine; narcotic analgesic agent; paracetamol; propofol; sevoflurane; unclassified drug; adult; aged; anesthesia induction; apoptosis; article; breast biopsy; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cell viability; clinical article; continuous infusion; controlled study; diagnostic kit; female; general anesthesia; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; luminescence; mastectomy; paravertebral analgesia; pilot study; postoperative analgesia; postoperative pain; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sentinel lymph node biopsy; serum; venous blood; wide excision","","fentanyl, 437-38-7; levobupivacaine, 27262-47-1, 27262-48-2; morphine, 52-26-6, 57-27-2; paracetamol, 103-90-2; propofol, 2078-54-8; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6","ApoLive-Glo Multiplex Assay, Promega, United Kingdom; diprifusor","Promega, United Kingdom","Sisk Healthcare Foundation; National Institute for Academic Anaesthesia, NIAA","This study was funded by the National Institute for Academic Anaesthesia UK and The Sisk Healthcare Foundation.","Jemal A., Siegel R., Ward E., Murray T., Xu J., Thun M.J., Cancer statistics, Cancer J Clin, 57, pp. 43-66, (2007); Hotchkiss R.S., Strasser A., McDunn J.E., Swanson P.E., Cell death, N Engl J Med, 361, pp. 1570-1583, (2009); Ben-Eliyahu S., The price of anticancer intervention Does surgery promote metastasis?, Lancet Oncol, 3, pp. 578-579, (2002); Holmgren L., O'Reilly M.S., Folkman J., Dormancy of micro metastases: Balanced proliferation and apoptosis in the presence of angiogen-esis suppression, Nat Med, 1, pp. 149-153, (1995); Shakhar G., Ben-Eliyahu S., Potential prophylactic measures against postoperative immunosuppression: Could they reduce recurrence rates in oncological patients?, Ann Surg Oncol, 10, pp. 972-992, (2003); Sessler D.I., Ben-Eliyahu S., Mascha E.J., Parat M.O., Buggy D.J., Can regional analgesia reduce the risk of recurrence after breast cancer?

It is predominantly used in anesthesia and is the most used parenteral anesthetic agent in the United States. Accumulating preclinical studies have shown that this compound may inhibit cancer recurrence and metastasis. Nevertheless, other investigations provided evidence that this compound may promote breast cancer cell progression by modulating different molecular pathways. Clinical data on this topic are scarce and derive from retrospective analyses. For this reason, we reviewed and evaluated the available data to reveal insight into this controversial issue. More preclinical and clinical investigations are necessary to determine the potential role of propofol in the proliferation of breast cancer cells. © 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

Neutrophil extracellular trapping (NETosis), an immunological process, has been linked to an increased susceptibility to metastasis in individuals with tumors. Furthermore, recurrence may be associated with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), a mediator of angiogenesis. This study investigates the impact of lidocaine (combined with sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia) during breast cancer surgery inhibits the expression of biomarkers associated with metastasis and recurrence (specifically H3Cit, NE, MPO, MMP-9 and VEGF-A). Methods: We randomly assigned 120 women undergoing primary or invasive breast tumor resection to receive one of four anesthetics: sevoflurane (S), sevoflurane plus i.v. lidocaine (SL), propofol (P), and propofol plus i.v. lidocaine (PL). Blood samples were collected before induction and 3 h after the operation. Biomarkers associated with NETosis (citrullinated histone H3 [H3Cit], myeloperoxidase [MPO], and neutrophil elastase [NE]) and angiogenesis were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Patient and breast tumor characteristics, along with perioperative management, did not differ between study groups. In intra-group comparisons, S and P groups demonstrated a statistically significant increase in post-operative MPO (S group: 10.39[6.89–17.22] vs. 14.31[8.55–20.87] ng ml-1, P = 0.032; P group: 9.45[6.73–17.37] vs. 14.34[9.87–19.75] ng ml-1, P = 0.035)and NE(S group: 182.70[85.66-285.85] vs. 226.20[91.85-391.65] ng ml-1, P = 0.045; P group: 154.22[97.31–325.30] vs. 308.66[132.36-483.57] ng ml-1, P = 0.037) concentrations compared to pre-operative measurements, whereas SL and PL groups did not display a similar increase. H3Cit, MMP-9, and VEGF-A concentrations were not significantly influenced by the anesthesia techniques and drugs. Conclusions: Regardless of the specific technique employed for general anesthesia, there was no increase in the postoperative serum concentrations of MPO and NE after perioperative lidocaine infusion compared to preoperative serum concentrations. This supports the hypothesis that intravenous lidocaine during cancer surgery aimed at achieving a cure may potentially decrease the likelihood of recurrence. Further interpretation and discussion of clinical implications are warranted, emphasizing the significance of these findings in the context of cancer surgery and recurrence prevention.

Propofol, one of the most extensively used intravenous anesthetics, provides its antioxidative activity via activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) pathway, but the mechanisms involved in the effects remain unknown. Thus, we aimed to investigate the function of p53 and Nrf2 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 following treatment with propofol. The cells were treated with propofol (2, 5 and 10 μg/ml) for 1, 4 and 12 h, and MTT assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation, and a wound healing assay was used to evaluate cell migration. Cell apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and western blot analysis for p53 and Nrf2 protein were also assessed. Finally, PIK-75, a potent Nrf2 inhibitor, was used to confirm the effects of Nrf2 after treatment with propofol. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with propofol resulted in increased proliferation and migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After treatment with propofol for 12 h, the Nrf2 protein expression was increased, while the percentage of apoptotic cells, caspase-3 activity, and expression of p53 were significantly decreased. Additionally, treatment with the Nrf2 inhibitor increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, inhibited the migration almost completely, and decreased the degree of proliferation, while the expression of p53 was not affected. In conclusion, propofol increased the proliferation of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, which was at least partially associated with the inhibition of the expression of p53, and induced cell migration, which was involved in the activation of the Nrf2 pathway.","MDA-MB-231 cells;

Propofol, which has anti-inflammatory properties in vitro, is clinically associated with reduced risk of cancer recurrence compared with sevoflurane anaesthesia in retrospective studies. Amide local anaesthetics, such as lidocaine, have cancer inhibiting effects in vitro. Steroids have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects and are associated with improved recovery after major non-cancer surgery. We compared the effects of propofol, lidocaine and methylprednisolone on postoperative metastasis in a murine model of breast cancer surgery under sevoflurane anaesthesia. 4T1 tumour cells were introduced into the mammary fat-pad of female BALB/c mice and the resulting tumour resected seven days later under general anaesthesia with sevoflurane. Mice (n = 72) were randomized to four treatment groups: Sevoflurane alone (control); Propofol group received 5 mg.kg-1; Lidocaine group received 1.5 mg.kg-1 followed by 2 mg.kg-1.h-1 infusion; Methylprednisolone group received 30 mg.kg-1 methylprednisolone. The primary outcome measure was pulmonary metastasis colony count, as assessed by in-vitro proliferation, two weeks post-operatively. This was achieved by treating the post-mortem lung tissue with collagenase IV, straining and culturing for 14 days prior to colony count. Compared with control, lidocaine and propofol each individually reduced pulmonary metastasis colonies; mean (SD) 846 (±581) vs. 88 (±52) vs. 34 (±44) respectively, (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0001). Methylprednisolone increased lung metastasis, 2555 (±609) vs. 846 (±581), p = 0.0001. Post-operative hepatic metastatic disease and serum interleukin-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were similar in all groups. In conclusion, in a murine model of breast cancer surgery during sevoflurane anaesthesia, propofol and lidocaine each decreased pulmonary metastasis, while methylprednisolone increased it. © 2019, MDPI AG.

Main Body: Anesthetics can affect cell biology through miRNA-mediated regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Indeed, sevoflurane was reported to upregulate miR-203 and suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation. Propofol reduces matrix metalloproteinase expression through its impact on miRNAs, leading to anti-cancer microenvironmental changes. Propofol also modifies miRNA expression profile in circulating extracellular vesicles with their subsequent anti-cancer effects via modulating cell-to-cell communication. Conclusion: Inhalational and intravenous anesthetics can alter cancer cell biology through various cellular signaling pathways induced by miRNAs’ modification. However, this area of research is insufficient and further study is needed to figure out optimal anesthesia regimens for cancer patients. © 2021, The Author(s).","Anesthetics; Anti-cancer immunity; Cancer; Cell-to-cell communication; MicroRNA","Anesthesia; Anesthetics; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA, Messenger; acetylsalicylic acid; anesthetic agent; antineoplastic agent; celecoxib; matrix metalloproteinase; messenger RNA; microRNA; mr X34; propofol; sevoflurane; unclassified drug; anesthetic agent; messenger RNA; microRNA; antineoplastic activity; backache; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cancer surgery; carcinogenesis; cell communication; cell proliferation; chill; clinical outcome; cytology; dendritic cell; drug targeting; esophagus cancer; exosome; fatigue; fever; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene function; glioma; helper cell; human; immune response; kidney carcinoma; liver tumor; lung adenocarcinoma; lung cancer; lymphoma; macrophage; malignant neoplasm; melanoma; miR 125a gene; miR 21 gene; miR 455 3p gene; MMP gene; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nasopharynx cancer; natural killer cell; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; perioperative period; phenotype; prostate cancer; rectum cancer; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; signal transduction; squamous cell carcinoma; stomach cancer; T lymphocyte; Th1 cell; tumor microenvironment; uterine cervix cancer; anesthesia; drug effect; gene expression regulation; neoplasm; procedures","","acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; celecoxib, 169590-42-5; propofol, 2078-54-8; sevoflurane, 28523-86-6; Anesthetics, ; MicroRNAs, ; RNA, Messenger, ","","","Ono Pharmaceutical, (O0190517001)","","Alkire B.C., Raykar N.P., Shrime M.G., Weiser T.G., Bickler S.W., Rose J.A., Nutt C.T., Greenberg S.L.M., Kotagal M., Riesel J.N., Et al., Global access to surgical care: a modelling study, Lancet Glob Health, 3, 6, pp. e316-e323, (2015); Mehlen P., Puisieux A., Metastasis: a question of life or death, Nat Rev Cancer, 6, 6, pp. 449-458, (2006); Nepogodiev D., Martin J., Biccard B., Makupe A., Bhangu A., Et al., Global burden of postoperative death, Lancet, 393, 10170, (2019); Sloan E.K., Priceman S.J., Cox B.F., Yu S., Pimentel M.A., Tangkanangnukul V., Arevalo J.M., Morizono K., Karanikolas B.D., Wu L., Et al., The sympathetic nervous system induces a metastatic switch in primary breast cancer, Cancer Res, 70, 18, pp. 7042-7052, (2010); Thaker P.H., Han L.Y., Kamat A.A., Arevalo J.M., Takahashi R., Lu C., Jennings N.B., Armaiz-Pena G., Bankson J.A., Ravoori M., Et al., Chronic stress promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis in a mouse model of ovarian carcinoma, Nat Med, 12, 8, pp. 939-944, (2006); Le C.P., Nowell C.J., Kim-Fuchs C., Botteri E., Hiller J.G., Ismail H., Pimentel M.A., Chai M.G., Karnezis T., Rotmensz N., Et al., Chronic stress in mice remodels lymph vasculature to promote tumour cell dissemination, Nat Commun, 7, (2016); Perry N.J.S., Buggy D., Ma D., Can anesthesia influence Cancer outcomes after surgery?, JAMA Surg, 154, 4, pp. 279-280, (2019); Huang H., Benzonana L.L., Zhao H., Watts H.R., Perry N.J., Bevan C., Brown R., Ma D., Prostate cancer cell malignancy via modulation of HIF-1alpha pathway with isoflurane and propofol alone and in combination, Br J Cancer, 111, 7, pp. 1338-1349, (2014); Wang C., Datoo T., Zhao H., Wu L., Date A., Jiang C., Sanders R.D., Wang G., Bevan C., Ma D., Midazolam and Dexmedetomidine affect Neuroglioma and lung carcinoma cell biology in vitro and in vivo, Anesthesiology, 129, 5, pp. 1000-1014, (2018); Wigmore T.J., Mohammed K., Jhanji S., Long-term survival for patients undergoing volatile versus IV anesthesia for Cancer surgery: a retrospective analysis, Anesthesiology, 124, 1, pp. 69-79, (2016); Karp X.A.V., Developmental biology.
